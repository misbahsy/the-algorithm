  "summary": "The `FinagleHttpClientBuilder` object provides two methods for building a Finagle HTTP client. The first method, `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls`, builds a client with S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. The second method, `buildFinagleHttpClient`, builds a client without Mutual TLS. \n\nBoth methods take in four parameters: `requestTimeout`, `connectTimeout`, `acquisitionTimeout`, and `statsReceiver`. `requestTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server. `connectTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a connection to be established with the server. `acquisitionTimeout` is the maximum amount of time the client will wait to acquire a session with the server. `statsReceiver` is used to collect statistics about the client's performance.\n\nThe `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method additionally takes in a `serviceIdentifier` parameter, which is used for S2S Auth / Mutual TLS. This method calls the `buildFinagleHttpClient` method to build the client, and then calls the `withMutualTls` method on the client to enable Mutual TLS with the given `serviceIdentifier`.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project to build HTTP clients for making requests to other services. The `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` method is likely used for services that require Mutual TLS authentication, while the `buildFinagleHttpClient` method is used for services that do not require Mutual TLS. The `statsReceiver` parameter is likely used to collect performance metrics for the clients, which can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of the system. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.http_client.FinagleHttpClientBuilder\nimport com.twitter.finagle.stats.NullStatsReceiver\nimport com.twitter.util.Duration\n\nval requestTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(10)\nval connectTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5)\nval acquisitionTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(2)\nval statsReceiver = NullStatsReceiver\n\n// Build a client without Mutual TLS\nval client = FinagleHttpClientBuilder.buildFinagleHttpClient(\n  requestTimeout = requestTimeout,\n  connectTimeout = connectTimeout,\n  acquisitionTimeout = acquisitionTimeout,\n  statsReceiver = statsReceiver\n)\n\n// Build a client with Mutual TLS\nval serviceIdentifier = ServiceIdentifier(\"my-service\")\nval mtlsClient = FinagleHttpClientBuilder.buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls(\n  requestTimeout = requestTimeout,\n  connectTimeout = connectTimeout,\n  acquisitionTimeout = acquisitionTimeout,\n  serviceIdentifier = serviceIdentifier,\n  statsReceiver = statsReceiver\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a Finagle HTTP client builder that can be used to build a client with S2S Auth/Mutual TLS or a regular client.\n\n2. What dependencies are required to use this code?\n    \n    This code requires the `com.twitter.finagle` library and its dependencies, as well as the `com.twitter.util.Duration` class.\n\n3. What is the difference between `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` and `buildFinagleHttpClient`?\n    \n    `buildFinagleHttpClientMutualTls` builds a Finagle HTTP client with S2S Auth/Mutual TLS, while `buildFinagleHttpClient` builds a regular Finagle HTTP client without S2S Auth/Mutual TLS."

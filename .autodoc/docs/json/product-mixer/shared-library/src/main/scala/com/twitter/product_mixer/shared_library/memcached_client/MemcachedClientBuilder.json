  "summary": "The `MemcachedClientBuilder` object in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.memcached_client` package provides methods to build a Finagle Memcached client. The `buildMemcachedClient` method takes in several parameters such as `destName`, `numTries`, `requestTimeout`, `globalTimeout`, `connectTimeout`, `acquisitionTimeout`, `serviceIdentifier`, `statsReceiver`, `failureAccrualPolicy`, and `keyHasher`. It returns a new Finagle Memcached client that is built using the `buildRawMemcachedClient` method.\n\nThe `buildRawMemcachedClient` method takes in similar parameters as the `buildMemcachedClient` method, but it returns a raw Memcached client instead of a Finagle Memcached client. It creates a new Memcached client using the `Memcached.client` builder and sets various configurations such as `connectTimeout`, `withMutualTls`, `acquisitionTimeout`, `withRequestTimeout`, `withStatsReceiver`, and `filtered`. The `filtered` configuration sets up a chain of filters that includes a `TimeoutFilter` and a `RetryExceptionsFilter`. The `keyHasher` and `failureAccrualPolicy` configurations are optional and are used to set the hash algorithm and failure accrual policy for the client, respectively.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to build a Finagle Memcached client with various configurations and options. It can be used in the larger project to interact with a Memcached server and cache data for faster access. Here is an example usage of the `buildMemcachedClient` method:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.memcached_client.MemcachedClientBuilder\nimport com.twitter.finagle.memcached.Client\nimport com.twitter.util.Duration\n\nval destName = \"/s/sample/sample\"\nval numTries = 3\nval requestTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(1)\nval globalTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5)\nval connectTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(1)\nval acquisitionTimeout = Duration.fromSeconds(5)\nval serviceIdentifier = ServiceIdentifier(\"my-service\")\nval statsReceiver = StatsReceiver.defaultNull\nval failureAccrualPolicy = Some(FailureAccrualPolicy.consecutiveFailures(5))\nval keyHasher = Some(KeyHasher.KETAMA)\n\nval client: Client = MemcachedClientBuilder.buildMemcachedClient(\n  destName,\n  numTries,\n  requestTimeout,\n  globalTimeout,\n  connectTimeout,\n  acquisitionTimeout,\n  serviceIdentifier,\n  statsReceiver,\n  failureAccrualPolicy,\n  keyHasher\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code builds a Finagle Memcached client for a given destination with specified parameters such as timeouts, retry policies, and stats.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to run?\n- This code requires dependencies from Finagle Memcached, Finagle MTLS, and Twitter Util.\n\n3. What is the default failure accrual policy and key hasher used by the Memcached client if they are not set?\n- The default failure accrual policy and key hasher will be used if they are not set."

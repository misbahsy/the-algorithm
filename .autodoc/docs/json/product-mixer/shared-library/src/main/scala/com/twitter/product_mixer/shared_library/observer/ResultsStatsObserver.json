  "summary": "The `ResultsStatsObserver` object provides helper functions to observe requests, successes, failures, cancellations, exceptions, latency, and result counts and time-series stats. It supports native functions and asynchronous operations. The object contains several helper functions that create instances of observer classes that extend the `Observer` trait. These observer classes include `StitchObserver`, `ArrowObserver`, `FutureObserver`, and `FunctionObserver`. Each observer class has a corresponding helper function that creates an instance of that observer class. \n\nThe observer classes are used to observe different types of computations. For example, the `StitchObserver` class is used to observe a `Stitch` computation, the `ArrowObserver` class is used to observe an `Arrow` computation, the `FutureObserver` class is used to observe a `Future` computation, and the `FunctionObserver` class is used to observe a function computation. \n\nEach observer class has an `apply` method that takes a computation and returns a new computation that records stats on the result after the original computation is run. The `ResultsStatsObserver` trait extends the `ResultsObserver` trait and provides an implementation of the `observeResults` method that records the size of the result and calls the `observeResultsWithSize` method. The `observeResultsWithSize` method is abstract and must be implemented by the observer classes to record additional stats on the result.\n\nThe `ResultsStatsObserver` object also provides helper functions to create instances of observer classes that transform the result before recording stats. These observer classes include `TransformingArrowResultsStatsObserver`. The `TransformingArrowResultsStatsObserver` class functions like an `ArrowObserver` except that it transforms the result using a provided transformer before recording stats. The original non-transformed result is then returned.\n\nOverall, the `ResultsStatsObserver` object provides a way to observe different types of computations and record stats on the results of those computations. It is a useful tool for monitoring the performance of a system and identifying areas for improvement. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()\nval observer = ResultsStatsObserver.stitchResultsStats[String](s => s.length, statsReceiver, \"myScope\")\nval stitched = Stitch(\"hello\", \"world\").map(_.mkString(\" \"))\nval observed = observer(stitched)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides helper functions to observe requests, successes, failures, cancellations, exceptions, latency, and result counts and time-series stats for native functions and asynchronous operations.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses external libraries such as Finagle, Stitch, and Twitter Util.\n\n3. What are some examples of how this code can be used?\n- This code can be used to observe and record stats for different types of operations such as stitches, arrows, futures, and functions. It also provides helper functions to observe traversable results such as Seq and Set."

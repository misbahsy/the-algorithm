  "summary": "The code defines a case class called `LatencyAlert` which is used to trigger an alert when the latency for a component rises above a certain threshold for a configured amount of time. This class extends the `Alert` trait and is observable from Strato. \n\nThe `LatencyAlert` class takes in several parameters including a `notificationGroup` which is used to group alerts together, a `percentile` which is the percentile value used to calculate the latency threshold, `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` which are instances of the `TriggerIfLatencyAbove` class that define the latency thresholds for warning and critical alerts, and an optional `runbookLink` which is a link to a runbook that provides instructions on how to handle the alert.\n\nThe `LatencyAlert` class also overrides the `alertType` and `metricSuffix` properties from the `Alert` trait. The `alertType` property is set to `Latency` to indicate that this alert is related to latency, while the `metricSuffix` property is set to the `metricSuffix` property of the `percentile` parameter.\n\nThis code is likely used as a part of a larger monitoring system to track the latency of various components and trigger alerts when latency exceeds certain thresholds. The `LatencyAlert` class can be instantiated with different parameters to create alerts for different components and with different thresholds. For example:\n\n```\nval alert = LatencyAlert(\n  notificationGroup = \"myGroup\",\n  percentile = 95,\n  warnPredicate = TriggerIfLatencyAbove(100),\n  criticalPredicate = TriggerIfLatencyAbove(200),\n  runbookLink = Some(\"https://example.com/runbook\")\n)\n```\n\nThis creates a `LatencyAlert` instance that triggers a warning alert if the latency for the component exceeds 100ms for 95% of requests, and a critical alert if the latency exceeds 200ms for 95% of requests. The alert is also associated with the \"myGroup\" notification group and has a runbook link provided.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LatencyAlert` case class?\n- The `LatencyAlert` case class is used to trigger an alert when the latency for a component rises above a certain threshold for a configured amount of time.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait?\n- The `IsObservableFromStrato` trait indicates that the `LatencyAlert` case class can be observed from Strato, which is likely a monitoring or alerting system.\n\n3. What other classes or components does the `LatencyAlert` case class depend on?\n- The `LatencyAlert` case class depends on the `NotificationGroup`, `Percentile`, `TriggerIfLatencyAbove`, and `Alert` classes/components."

  "summary": "The code defines a case class called `ThroughputAlert` that is used to trigger alerts when the requests per second for a component is outside of a set predicate for a configured amount of time. The class takes in four parameters: `notificationGroup`, `warnPredicate`, `criticalPredicate`, and `runbookLink`. \n\nThe `notificationGroup` parameter specifies the group that should be notified when the alert is triggered. The `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` parameters are instances of the `ThroughputPredicate` class, which is used to set the thresholds for when the alert should be triggered. The `runbookLink` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies a link to a runbook that can be used to resolve the issue that triggered the alert.\n\nThe `ThroughputAlert` class extends the `Alert` class and implements the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait. The `Alert` class provides a base implementation for alerts, while the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait is used to indicate that the alert can be observed from Strato, which is a monitoring and alerting system used by Twitter.\n\nThe `ThroughputAlert` class also overrides the `alertType` property to set it to `Throughput`, which is an enumeration that represents the type of alert. Additionally, the class includes two `require` statements that ensure that the thresholds for the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` parameters are greater than or equal to zero.\n\nOverall, this code is used to define a specific type of alert that can be triggered when the requests per second for a component is outside of a set threshold. This alert can be observed from Strato and can be configured with a notification group and a runbook link. This code is likely part of a larger project that includes monitoring and alerting functionality for Twitter's services. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval notificationGroup = NotificationGroup(\"my-group\")\nval warnPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(100)\nval criticalPredicate = ThroughputPredicate(50)\nval runbookLink = Some(\"https://my-runbook.com\")\n\nval throughputAlert = ThroughputAlert(notificationGroup, warnPredicate, criticalPredicate, runbookLink)\n\n// Trigger the alert if requests per second is below 50 for 5 minutes\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ThroughputAlert` class?\n- The `ThroughputAlert` class is used to trigger an alert when the requests/sec for a component is outside of the predicate set by a `ThroughputPredicate` for a configured amount of time.\n\n2. What other classes or components are used in this code?\n- The code imports `ThroughputPredicate` from `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert.predicate` and extends `Alert` and `IsObservableFromStrato`.\n\n3. What are the requirements for the `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds?\n- The `warnPredicate` and `criticalPredicate` thresholds must be greater than or equal to 0, as indicated by the `require` statements in the code."

  "summary": "The UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller class is a part of the functional component of the product_mixer core in the Twitter project. The purpose of this class is to convert an instance of the UrtEndpointOptions class to an instance of the thriftscala UrtEndpointOptions class. This conversion is necessary for the UrtEndpointOptions object to be used in other parts of the project that require the thriftscala version of the object.\n\nThe class is annotated with the @Singleton annotation, which means that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the entire project. This is useful for reducing memory usage and improving performance.\n\nThe apply method of the class takes an instance of the UrtEndpointOptions class as input and returns an instance of the thriftscala UrtEndpointOptions class. The method simply maps the fields of the input object to the corresponding fields of the output object.\n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nval urtEndpointOptions = UrtEndpointOptions(\n  requestParams = Map(\"param1\" -> \"value1\", \"param2\" -> \"value2\"),\n  title = \"Example Endpoint\",\n  cacheId = Some(\"example_cache_id\"),\n  subtitle = Some(\"Example Subtitle\")\n)\n\nval urtEndpointOptionsMarshaller = new UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller()\n\nval thriftscalaUrtEndpointOptions = urtEndpointOptionsMarshaller(urtEndpointOptions)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the UrtEndpointOptions class with some sample data. We then create an instance of the UrtEndpointOptionsMarshaller class and use it to convert the UrtEndpointOptions object to a thriftscala UrtEndpointOptions object. The resulting object can then be used in other parts of the project that require the thriftscala version of the object.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a marshaller for UrtEndpointOptions, which is a model for metadata in a response from a Twitter API endpoint. It converts UrtEndpointOptions to a thriftscala UrtEndpointOptions object.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to work?\n- This code requires dependencies from com.twitter.product_mixer.core, com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala, and javax.inject.\n\n3. What design pattern is being used in this code?\n- This code is using the Singleton design pattern, as indicated by the @Singleton annotation on the class. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created and used throughout the application."

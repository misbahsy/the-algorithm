  "summary": "The code defines a side-effect that can be run with a pipeline result before transport marshalling. The `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait is a type parameterized trait that extends the `SideEffect` trait and the `SupportsConditionally` trait from the `common` package. The `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait takes two type parameters: `Query` and `ResultType`. `Query` is a type parameter that represents the pipeline query, and `ResultType` is a type parameter that represents the response after domain marshalling.\n\nThe `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait defines a method `onlyIf` that takes five parameters: `query`, `selectedCandidates`, `remainingCandidates`, `droppedCandidates`, and `response`. These parameters represent the pipeline query, the selected candidates, the remaining candidates, the dropped candidates, and the response after domain marshalling, respectively. The `onlyIf` method returns a boolean value that determines whether the side-effect should be run or not.\n\nThe `PipelineResultSideEffect` object defines a nested trait `Conditionally` that extends the `common.Conditionally` trait and is mixed in with the `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait. The `Conditionally` trait provides a nicer API for the `PipelineResultSideEffect` specific use-case.\n\nThe `PipelineResultSideEffect` object also defines a case class `Inputs` that takes five type parameters: `Query`, `ResultType`, `selectedCandidates`, `remainingCandidates`, and `droppedCandidates`. The `Inputs` case class represents the inputs to the side-effect.\n\nOverall, this code defines a side-effect that can be run with a pipeline result before transport marshalling. It provides a way to conditionally run the side-effect based on the pipeline query, the selected candidates, the remaining candidates, the dropped candidates, and the response after domain marshalling. This side-effect can be used in the larger project to perform additional processing on the pipeline result before it is marshalled for transport.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?\n- This code defines a side-effect that can be run with a pipeline result before transport marshalling. It is part of the functional component of the product mixer core and is used to conditionally run a PipelineResultSideEffect.\n\n2. What are the input and output types for the PipelineResultSideEffect?\n- The input types for the PipelineResultSideEffect are a PipelineQuery and a ResultType that extends HasMarshalling. The output type is a SideEffect with Inputs of the aforementioned types.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the Conditionally trait and how is it used?\n- The Conditionally trait is a mixin that allows for conditional running of a PipelineResultSideEffect. It is a thin wrapper around common.Conditionally and exposes a nicer API for the PipelineResultSideEffect specific use-case. It is used to define a method onlyIf that takes in various parameters and returns a Boolean value to determine if the side-effect should be run."

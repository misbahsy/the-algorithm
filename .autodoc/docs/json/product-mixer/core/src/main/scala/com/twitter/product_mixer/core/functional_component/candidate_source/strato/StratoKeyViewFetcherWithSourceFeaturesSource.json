  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `StratoKeyViewFetcherWithSourceFeaturesSource` that extends `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures`. This trait is used to get candidates from Strato, where the Strato column's view is `StratoView` and the value is a `StratoValue`. The `StratoKeyViewFetcherWithSourceFeaturesSource` trait requires a `stratoResultTransformer` and an `extractFeaturesFromStratoResult` method to be defined. \n\nThe `stratoResultTransformer` method is used to transform the value type returned by Strato into a sequence of candidates. This method can be as simple as `Seq(stratoResult)` if a single candidate is always returned. Often, it extracts a sequence from within a larger wrapper object. \n\nThe `extractFeaturesFromStratoResult` method is used to extract global metadata like cursors and place the results into a feature. For example, a cursor. \n\nThe `apply` method is overridden to use the `fetch` method of the `Fetcher` class to get the candidates from Strato. The `fetch` method returns a `Stitch` object that is mapped to a `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object. The `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object contains the candidates and features extracted from the Strato result. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to get candidates from Strato and extract features from the Strato result. It can be used as a building block in a larger project that requires candidate generation and feature extraction from Strato data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// Define a class that extends StratoKeyViewFetcherWithSourceFeaturesSource\nclass MyStratoFetcher extends StratoKeyViewFetcherWithSourceFeaturesSource[String, String, String, String] {\n  override val fetcher: Fetcher[String, String, String] = ???\n\n  override protected def stratoResultTransformer(stratoKey: String, stratoResult: String): Seq[String] = ???\n\n  override protected def extractFeaturesFromStratoResult(stratoKey: String, stratoResult: String): FeatureMap = ???\n}\n\n// Use the MyStratoFetcher to get candidates and features from Strato\nval myFetcher = new MyStratoFetcher()\nval request = StratoKeyView(\"key\", \"view\")\nval stitch = myFetcher(request)\nval candidatesWithFeatures = stitch.get()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a trait for a candidate source that retrieves candidates from Strato and extracts features from the StratoValue. It solves the problem of retrieving candidates and features from Strato.\n\n2. What are the input and output types of the `stratoResultTransformer` and `extractFeaturesFromStratoResult` methods?\n- Both methods take a `StratoKey` and a `StratoValue` as input. `stratoResultTransformer` returns a `Seq[Candidate]` while `extractFeaturesFromStratoResult` returns a `FeatureMap`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Stitch` and `Fetcher` classes imported in this code?\n- `Stitch` is used to compose asynchronous operations while `Fetcher` is used to fetch data from Strato based on a given key and view."

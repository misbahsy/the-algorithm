  "summary": "The `TombstoneDisplayTypeMarshaller` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting a `TombstoneDisplayType` object into a `urt.TombstoneDisplayType` object. \n\nThe `TombstoneDisplayType` object is an enum that represents the different types of tombstones that can be displayed for a tweet. A tombstone is a message that is displayed when a tweet is no longer available, either because it has been deleted or because it is no longer accessible. The different types of tombstones that can be displayed are `TweetUnavailable`, `DisconnectedRepliesAncestor`, `DisconnectedRepliesDescendant`, `Inline`, and `NonCompliant`. \n\nThe `TombstoneDisplayTypeMarshaller` class has a single method called `apply` that takes a `TombstoneDisplayType` object as input and returns a `urt.TombstoneDisplayType` object. The `urt.TombstoneDisplayType` object is a Thrift-generated class that is used to represent the different types of tombstones that can be displayed in the user interface. \n\nThe `apply` method uses pattern matching to determine the type of tombstone that is being passed in and returns the corresponding `urt.TombstoneDisplayType` object. For example, if the input is `TweetUnavailable`, the method returns `urt.TombstoneDisplayType.TweetUnavailable`. \n\nThis class is likely used in other parts of the project where tombstones need to be displayed for tweets that are no longer available. For example, it may be used in the user interface to display tombstones for deleted tweets or tweets that are no longer accessible. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval tombstoneDisplayTypeMarshaller = new TombstoneDisplayTypeMarshaller()\nval tombstoneDisplayType = TombstoneDisplayType.TweetUnavailable\nval urtTombstoneDisplayType = tombstoneDisplayTypeMarshaller(tombstoneDisplayType)\n// urtTombstoneDisplayType is now urt.TombstoneDisplayType.TweetUnavailable\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code is a Scala class that defines a marshaller for converting a TombstoneDisplayType object to a corresponding thriftscala object. It is used in the Twitter product mixer core functional component for handling tombstone items in user timelines.\n   \n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code depends on several other classes and packages, including com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.tombstone, com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala, javax.inject, and javax.inject.Singleton.\n   \n3. What is the expected input and output of the apply() method?\n   - The apply() method takes a TombstoneDisplayType object as input and returns a corresponding urt.TombstoneDisplayType object. The input object is matched against several possible cases and the corresponding urt.TombstoneDisplayType value is returned."

  "summary": "The code defines a case class called PromotedMetadata which represents metadata for a promoted tweet. The class has several fields including advertiserId, disclosureType, experimentValues, promotedTrendId, promotedTrendName, promotedTrendQueryTerm, adMetadataContainer, promotedTrendDescription, impressionString, and clickTrackingInfo. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a data structure for storing metadata related to a promoted tweet. This metadata can be used by other parts of the larger project to track and analyze the performance of promoted tweets. \n\nThe code also includes a comment explaining a change made to the class based on a discussion with the revenue-serving team. The impressionId field was removed from the class because it often returns None from the adserver and can cause crashes on Android devices if not filled out. Instead, the impressionString field will be used to set both impressionId and impressionString in the render thrift. \n\nHere is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval metadata = PromotedMetadata(\n  advertiserId = 12345,\n  disclosureType = Some(DisclosureType(\"sponsored\")),\n  experimentValues = Some(Map(\"key1\" -> \"value1\", \"key2\" -> \"value2\")),\n  promotedTrendId = Some(67890),\n  promotedTrendName = Some(\"My Trend\"),\n  promotedTrendQueryTerm = Some(\"#mytrend\"),\n  adMetadataContainer = Some(AdMetadataContainer(\"myad\")),\n  promotedTrendDescription = Some(\"Description of my trend\"),\n  impressionString = Some(\"123abc\"),\n  clickTrackingInfo = Some(ClickTrackingInfo(\"http://example.com/click\"))\n)\n\n// Use the metadata to track the performance of a promoted tweet\ntrackPromotedTweet(metadata)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PromotedMetadata` case class?\n- The `PromotedMetadata` case class is used to store information about a promoted trend, including advertiser ID, disclosure type, experiment values, and click tracking information.\n\n2. Why was `impressionId` removed from the case class?\n- `impressionId` was removed from the case class because it often returns None from the adserver and Android crashes without it filled out in the response. Instead, `impressionString` is used to set both `impressionId` and `impressionString` in the render thrift.\n\n3. What is the `AdMetadataContainer` option used for?\n- The `AdMetadataContainer` option is used to store additional metadata about the ad, such as the ad format and creative ID."

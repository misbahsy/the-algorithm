  "summary": "The `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait is a candidate source for getting candidates from Strato. Strato is a columnar storage system used by Twitter for storing and querying large amounts of data. This trait is used to get candidates from Strato where the Strato column's view is `StratoView` and the value is a `StratoValue`. \n\nThe `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait extends the `CandidateSource` trait, which means that it provides an implementation of the `apply` method that returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[Candidate]`. The `apply` method takes a `StratoKeyView[StratoKey, StratoView]` request and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[Candidate]`. \n\nThe `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait has a `fetcher` field of type `Fetcher[StratoKey, StratoView, StratoValue]`. The `fetcher` is used to fetch the data from Strato. \n\nThe `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait has a `stratoResultTransformer` method that transforms the value type returned by Strato into a `Seq[Candidate]`. The `stratoResultTransformer` method takes a `StratoKey` and a `StratoValue` and returns a `Seq[Candidate]`. The `stratoResultTransformer` method is called by the `apply` method to transform the `StratoValue` into a `Seq[Candidate]`. \n\nThe `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait is used in the larger project to get candidates from Strato. The `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` trait is extended by other traits or classes that provide specific implementations of the `stratoResultTransformer` method. These implementations are used to transform the `StratoValue` into a `Seq[Candidate]` that is specific to the use case. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// Define a case class for the Candidate\ncase class MyCandidate(name: String, age: Int)\n\n// Define a class that extends the StratoKeyViewFetcherSource trait\nclass MyStratoKeyViewFetcherSource extends StratoKeyViewFetcherSource[String, String, String, MyCandidate] {\n  override val fetcher: Fetcher[String, String, String] = ???\n\n  override protected def stratoResultTransformer(stratoKey: String, stratoResult: String): Seq[MyCandidate] = {\n    // Transform the StratoValue into a Seq[MyCandidate]\n    Seq(MyCandidate(stratoResult, 30))\n  }\n}\n\n// Use the MyStratoKeyViewFetcherSource to get candidates from Strato\nval myStratoKeyViewFetcherSource = new MyStratoKeyViewFetcherSource()\nval request = StratoKeyView(\"key\", \"view\")\nval stitch: Stitch[Seq[MyCandidate]] = myStratoKeyViewFetcherSource.apply(request)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a trait called `StratoKeyViewFetcherSource` which extends `CandidateSource` and provides a way to get candidates from Strato based on a specific column's view and value. It also defines a method to transform the Strato value into a sequence of candidates.\n\n2. What other classes or methods does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several other classes and methods from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.candidate_source` package, as well as the `com.twitter.stitch.Stitch` and `com.twitter.strato.client.Fetcher` classes.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `stratoResultTransformer` method?\n- The `stratoResultTransformer` method takes in a Strato key and value and is expected to return a sequence of candidates. The method is meant to transform the Strato value into a format that can be used as a candidate. The output can be a simple sequence of candidates or a sequence of tuples containing both candidates and metadata."

  "summary": "The `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait and its companion object provide functionality for serializing and deserializing a `PipelineCursor` object into a base64 encoded string using Thrift serialization. \n\nThe `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait is a type class that defines a single method `serializeCursor` which takes a `PipelineCursor` object and returns a base64 encoded string representation of the object. This method must be implemented by any class that extends the `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait. \n\nThe `PipelineCursorSerializer` companion object provides a method `deserializeCursor` which takes a base64 encoded string, a `BinaryThriftStructSerializer` object, and a partial function that transforms the deserialized Thrift object into a `PipelineCursor` object. The method returns an optional `PipelineCursor` object. If the deserialization fails, `None` is returned. The `deserializeCursor` method first deserializes the base64 encoded string into a Thrift object using the `BinaryThriftStructSerializer` object. If the deserialization is successful, the partial function is applied to the Thrift object to obtain a `PipelineCursor` object. If the partial function is not defined for the Thrift object, a default partial function is used that throws a `PipelineFailure` exception with a message indicating that the cursor is malformed. \n\nThis functionality is useful in the larger project because it allows for the serialization and deserialization of `PipelineCursor` objects, which are used throughout the project to represent cursors for data retrieval. For example, the `PipelineCursorSerializer` may be used in a data retrieval pipeline to serialize a `PipelineCursor` object before sending it to a remote service, and then deserialize the response from the remote service back into a `PipelineCursor` object. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.{PipelineCursor, PipelineCursorSerializer}\nimport com.twitter.scrooge.BinaryThriftStructSerializer\n\ncase class MyCursor(id: Int) extends PipelineCursor\n\nclass MyCursorSerializer extends PipelineCursorSerializer[MyCursor] {\n  override def serializeCursor(cursor: MyCursor): String = {\n    // serialize MyCursor object to base64 encoded string using Thrift serialization\n    ???\n  }\n}\n\nval cursor = MyCursor(123)\nval serializer = new MyCursorSerializer()\nval serializedCursor = serializer.serializeCursor(cursor)\n\nval thriftSerializer = new BinaryThriftStructSerializer[MyThriftStruct]()\nval deserializePf: PartialFunction[Option[MyThriftStruct], Option[MyCursor]] = {\n  case Some(thrift) => Some(MyCursor(thrift.id))\n}\nval deserializedCursor = PipelineCursorSerializer.deserializeCursor(serializedCursor, thriftSerializer, deserializePf)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait?\n- The `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait is used to serialize a `PipelineCursor` into thrift and then into a base64 encoded string.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `deserializeCursor` method?\n- The `deserializeCursor` method is used to deserialize a cursor string into thrift and then into a `PipelineCursor`.\n\n3. Why might invokers need to add an explicit type on the `deserializeCursor` call?\n- Invokers might need to add an explicit type on the `deserializeCursor` call to help out the compiler when passing `deserializePf` inline, since the \"A\" type of `deserializePf` cannot be inferred due to the thrift type not being present on the `PipelineCursorSerializer` trait. Alternatively, `deserializePf` can be declared as a val with a type annotation before it is passed into the method."

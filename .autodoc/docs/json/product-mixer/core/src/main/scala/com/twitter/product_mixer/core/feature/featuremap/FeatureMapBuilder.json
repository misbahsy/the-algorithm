  "summary": "The `FeatureMapBuilder` class is a builder for creating a `FeatureMap`, which is a map of `Feature`s to their values. The purpose of this class is to provide a type-safe way to build a `FeatureMap` by checking the types of the `Feature`s being added. \n\nThe `FeatureMapBuilder` class has several methods for adding `Feature`s to the map. The `add` method takes a `Feature` and a value wrapped in a `Try` and adds it to the map. The `add` method can also take a `Feature` and a value directly, without wrapping it in a `Try`. The `addFailure` method takes a `Feature` and a `Throwable` and adds a failed `Feature` to the map. The `addTry` method is similar to the `add` method, but it is used when the `Feature` types are not known. \n\nThe `FeatureMapBuilder` class also has a method for building the `FeatureMap`. Once the `build` method is called, the `FeatureMapBuilder` cannot be used again. If the `build` method is called more than once, a `ReusedFeatureMapBuilderException` is thrown.\n\nIf the same `Feature` is added to the `FeatureMapBuilder` more than once, a `DuplicateFeatureException` is thrown. \n\nOverall, the `FeatureMapBuilder` class provides a type-safe way to build a `FeatureMap` by checking the types of the `Feature`s being added. This class is used in the larger project to create `FeatureMap`s that are used in other parts of the codebase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval builder = FeatureMapBuilder()\nval feature1 = Feature(\"feature1\", classOf[String])\nval feature2 = Feature(\"feature2\", classOf[Int])\nbuilder.add(feature1, \"value1\")\nbuilder.add(feature2, 42)\nval featureMap = builder.build()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the FeatureMapBuilder class?\n   \n   The FeatureMapBuilder class is a typesafe way to build a FeatureMap, which is a map of Feature objects and their corresponding values.\n\n2. What happens if the same Feature is added more than once?\n   \n   If the same Feature is added more than once, a DuplicateFeatureException is thrown.\n\n3. Can FeatureMapBuilders be reused?\n   \n   No, FeatureMapBuilders are not reusable. If build() is called more than once, a ReusedFeatureMapBuilderException is thrown."

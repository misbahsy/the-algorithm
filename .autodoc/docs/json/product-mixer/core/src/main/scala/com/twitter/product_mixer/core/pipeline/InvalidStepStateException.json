  "summary": "This code defines a case class called `InvalidStepStateException` that extends the built-in `Exception` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a custom exception that can be thrown when a pipeline step is in an invalid state due to missing data. \n\nThe `InvalidStepStateException` takes two parameters: `step` and `missingData`. `step` is of type `PipelineStepIdentifier`, which is a custom class that represents a unique identifier for a pipeline step. `missingData` is a string that describes the missing data that caused the exception to be thrown. \n\nThis exception can be used in the larger project to handle errors that occur during the execution of the pipeline. For example, if a pipeline step requires certain data to be present in order to execute, but that data is missing, the step can throw an `InvalidStepStateException` with a message indicating what data is missing. This can then be caught by the pipeline and handled appropriately, such as by skipping the step or retrying it later when the missing data is available. \n\nHere is an example of how this exception might be used in the context of a pipeline step:\n\n```scala\ndef executeStep(step: PipelineStep): Unit = {\n  val requiredData = step.getRequiredData()\n  if (requiredData.isEmpty) {\n    // execute the step\n  } else {\n    val missingData = requiredData.filterNot(data => pipelineData.contains(data))\n    throw InvalidStepStateException(step.getId(), missingData.mkString(\", \"))\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `executeStep` checks if all the required data for the step is present in the `pipelineData` map. If any data is missing, an `InvalidStepStateException` is thrown with a message indicating what data is missing. This allows the pipeline to handle the error and take appropriate action.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nA smart developer might ask what the overall goal of this code is and how it fits into the larger project. \n\n2. **What is the `InvalidStepStateException` case class used for?**\\\nA smart developer might ask how this case class is used within the pipeline and what specific errors it is designed to handle.\n\n3. **What is the significance of the `PipelineStepIdentifier` import statement?**\\\nA smart developer might ask why this import statement is necessary and what other components of the project rely on it."

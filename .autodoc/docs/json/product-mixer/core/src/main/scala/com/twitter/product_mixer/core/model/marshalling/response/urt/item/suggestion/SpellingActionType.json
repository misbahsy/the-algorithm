  "summary": "This code defines a set of three case objects that represent different types of spelling suggestions that can be returned by the URT API. The SpellingActionType trait is sealed, which means that all of its implementations must be defined in this file. \n\nThe first case object, ReplaceSpellingActionType, is used when the original query is replaced by another query in the backend. This suggestion is displayed to the user as \"Searching instead for ...\". \n\nThe second case object, ExpandSpellingActionType, is used when the original query is expanded by a suggestion when performing the search. This suggestion is displayed to the user as \"Including results for ...\". \n\nThe third case object, SuggestSpellingActionType, is used when the search query is not changed and a suggestion is displayed as an alternative query. This suggestion is displayed to the user as \"Did you mean ... ?\". \n\nThese case objects are used in other parts of the URT API to represent different types of spelling suggestions. For example, a response from the API might include a field that specifies the type of spelling suggestion that was returned, and this field would be set to one of these case objects. \n\nHere is an example of how these case objects might be used in a response from the URT API:\n\n```scala\ncase class SpellingSuggestion(suggestion: String, actionType: SpellingActionType)\n\nval response = // some response from the URT API\n\nval suggestion = response.suggestion\nval actionType = response.actionType match {\n  case ReplaceSpellingActionType => \"Searching instead for ...\"\n  case ExpandSpellingActionType => \"Including results for ...\"\n  case SuggestSpellingActionType => \"Did you mean ... ?\"\n}\n\nprintln(s\"$actionType $suggestion\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a case class SpellingSuggestion that represents a spelling suggestion returned by the URT API. We then extract the suggestion and actionType fields from some response object, and use a pattern match to determine the text that should be displayed to the user based on the type of spelling suggestion. Finally, we print out the suggestion with the appropriate text.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a sealed trait and three case objects that represent different types of Spelling Suggestion items.\n\n2. What is the URT API Reference and how is it related to this code?\n- The URT API Reference is a documentation for the Unified Rich Timelines (URT) API. It is related to this code because it provides information about the SpellingActionType trait that this code defines.\n\n3. How might a developer use these SpellingActionType objects in their code?\n- A developer might use these objects to represent different types of spelling suggestions in their application. They can match on the objects to determine what type of suggestion to display to the user."

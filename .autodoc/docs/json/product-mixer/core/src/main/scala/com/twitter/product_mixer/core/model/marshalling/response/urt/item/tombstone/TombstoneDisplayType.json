  "summary": "This code defines a sealed trait called `TombstoneDisplayType` and five case objects that extend it. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to represent different types of tombstones in the context of the larger project, which likely involves handling deleted or unavailable content on Twitter.\n\nA tombstone is a placeholder that indicates that content is no longer available or has been deleted. The different types of tombstones represented by the case objects in this code are:\n\n- `TweetUnavailable`: Indicates that a tweet is no longer available.\n- `DisconnectedRepliesAncestor`: Indicates that a reply to a tweet is no longer available because the original tweet has been deleted.\n- `DisconnectedRepliesDescendant`: Indicates that a reply to a tweet is no longer available because the reply itself has been deleted.\n- `Inline`: Indicates that a tweet has been replaced with a tombstone that is displayed inline with other tweets.\n- `NonCompliant`: Indicates that a tweet has been deleted because it violated Twitter's terms of service.\n\nThese tombstone types can be used in the larger project to handle different scenarios where content is no longer available. For example, if a user tries to view a tweet that has been deleted, the tombstone type `TweetUnavailable` can be used to display a message indicating that the tweet is no longer available.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval tombstoneType: TombstoneDisplayType = TweetUnavailable\n\ntombstoneType match {\n  case TweetUnavailable => println(\"This tweet is no longer available.\")\n  case DisconnectedRepliesAncestor => println(\"This reply is no longer available because the original tweet has been deleted.\")\n  case DisconnectedRepliesDescendant => println(\"This reply is no longer available because it has been deleted.\")\n  case Inline => println(\"This tweet has been replaced with a tombstone that is displayed inline with other tweets.\")\n  case NonCompliant => println(\"This tweet has been deleted because it violated Twitter's terms of service.\")\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TombstoneDisplayType` is set to `TweetUnavailable`, and a match statement is used to determine which message to display based on the tombstone type.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?\n- This code defines a sealed trait and several case objects related to tombstone display types. It is likely used in the response marshalling process for the product mixer core model, but further context is needed to understand its exact role in the project.\n\n2. What is a tombstone display type and how does it relate to Twitter's functionality?\n- Without additional context, it is unclear what a tombstone display type represents in the context of Twitter. It may be related to displaying deleted or hidden tweets, but further investigation is needed to confirm this.\n\n3. Are there any other tombstone display types that are not included in this code?\n- It is possible that there are additional tombstone display types that are not defined in this code. A smart developer may want to investigate the project further to see if there are any missing cases that need to be accounted for."

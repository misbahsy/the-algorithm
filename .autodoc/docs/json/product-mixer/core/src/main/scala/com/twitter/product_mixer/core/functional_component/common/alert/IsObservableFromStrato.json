  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `IsObservableFromStrato` which is used to indicate that an `Alert` can be passed to `StratoColumnAlert`. The purpose of this trait is to limit the types of alerts that can be observed from Strato's perspective, as the available metrics may not allow for all types of alerts to be observed.\n\nThis trait is meant to be used in conjunction with the `Alert` class, which is not defined in this file. By extending the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait, an `Alert` can be marked as observable from Strato and passed to `StratoColumnAlert`.\n\nHere is an example of how this trait may be used:\n\n```\nclass MyAlert extends Alert with IsObservableFromStrato {\n  // implementation of MyAlert class\n}\n\nval myStratoAlert = new StratoColumnAlert(new MyAlert())\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyAlert` extends `Alert` and also includes the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait. This allows it to be passed to `StratoColumnAlert` as a Strato observable alert.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a way to limit the types of alerts that can be observed from Strato's perspective and ensure that only compatible alerts are passed to `StratoColumnAlert`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IsObservableFromStrato` trait?\n   - The `IsObservableFromStrato` trait indicates that an `Alert` can be passed to `StratoColumnAlert`, but not all `Alert`s can be Strato alerts due to limited metrics available for observation from Strato's perspective.\n\n2. What is the relationship between `IsObservableFromStrato` and `Alert`?\n   - The `IsObservableFromStrato` trait can only be used in conjunction with `Alert`.\n\n3. What is the overall functionality of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert` package?\n   - The `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common.alert` package contains common alert functionality, including the ability to observe alerts from Strato's perspective."

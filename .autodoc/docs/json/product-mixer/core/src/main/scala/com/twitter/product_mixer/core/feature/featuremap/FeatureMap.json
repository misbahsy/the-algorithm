  "summary": "The `FeatureMap` class is a container for a set of features and their values, associated with a specific instance of an Entity. It is used to build new FeatureMap instances using the `FeatureMapBuilder`. The class has several methods for retrieving and manipulating features, including `get`, `getTry`, `getOrElse`, `+`, and `++`. \n\nThe `get` method returns the `Value` associated with the `Feature`. If the `Feature` is missing from the feature map, it throws a `MissingFeatureException`. If the `Feature` failed and isn't a `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure`, this will throw the underlying exception that the feature failed with during hydration.\n\nThe `getTry` method returns the `Value` associated with the `Feature` with the same semantics as `FeatureMap.get()`, but the underlying `Try` is returned to allow for checking the success or error state of a feature hydration. This is helpful for implementing fall-back behavior in case the feature is missing or hydration failed without a `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure` set.\n\nThe `getOrElse` method returns the `Value` associated with the feature or a default if the key is not contained in the map. `default` can also be used to throw an exception. For `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure`, the `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure.defaultValue` will be returned if the `Feature` failed, but if it is missing/never hydrated, then the `default` provided here will be used.\n\nThe `+` method returns a new `FeatureMap` with the new `Feature` and `Value` pair if the `Feature` was not present, or overriding the previous `Value` if that `Feature` was previously present.\n\nThe `++` method returns a new `FeatureMap` with all the elements of the current `FeatureMap` and `other`. If a `Feature` exists in both maps, the `Value` from `other` takes precedence.\n\nThe `getFeatures` method returns the keySet of `Features` in the map.\n\nThe `getSuccessfulFeatures` method returns the set of `Features` in the `FeatureMap` that have a successfully returned value. Failed features will obviously not be here.\n\nThe `isEmpty` method returns a boolean indicating whether the `FeatureMap` is empty.\n\nThe `toString` method returns a string representation of the `FeatureMap`.\n\nThe `FeatureMap` object has a private `apply` method that restricts access to the method. The object also has a `merge` method that merges an arbitrary number of `FeatureMap`s from left-to-right. \n\nIn summary, the `FeatureMap` class is a container for a set of features and their values, associated with a specific instance of an Entity. It provides methods for retrieving and manipulating features, and the `FeatureMapBuilder` is used to build new `FeatureMap` instances. The `FeatureMap` object has a `merge` method that merges an arbitrary number of `FeatureMap`s from left-to-right.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FeatureMap` class and how is it used in the project?\n- The `FeatureMap` class represents a set of features and their values associated with a specific instance of an Entity. It is used to retrieve and store feature values, and can be built using the `FeatureMapBuilder` class. \n\n2. What is the significance of the `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure` trait and how is it used in the `FeatureMap` class?\n- The `FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure` trait is used to provide a default value for a feature in case it fails during hydration. It is used in the `FeatureMap` class to prioritize the default value over the underlying exception when retrieving a feature value.\n\n3. How does the `merge` method in the `FeatureMap` object work and what is its purpose?\n- The `merge` method in the `FeatureMap` object is used to merge an arbitrary number of `FeatureMap` instances from left-to-right. It uses a `FeatureMapBuilder` to accumulate the features and their values, and prioritizes the values from the rightmost `FeatureMap`. It also handles merging of `FeatureStoreV1Response` features separately."

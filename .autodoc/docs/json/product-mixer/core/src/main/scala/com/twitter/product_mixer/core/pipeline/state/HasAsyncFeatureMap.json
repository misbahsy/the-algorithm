  "summary": "The code above defines a trait called `HasAsyncFeatureMap` which is used to represent a state that has an `AsyncFeatureMap`. An `AsyncFeatureMap` is a data structure that maps features to their corresponding values asynchronously. \n\nThe purpose of this trait is to provide a common interface for states that have an `AsyncFeatureMap`. This allows for easier management and manipulation of states within the larger project. \n\nThe trait has one abstract method called `asyncFeatureMap` which returns an instance of `AsyncFeatureMap`. This method must be implemented by any class that extends this trait. \n\nThe trait also has a private method called `addAsyncFeatureMap` which takes in a new `AsyncFeatureMap` and returns a new instance of the state with the new `AsyncFeatureMap` added. This method is only accessible within the `core` package, indicating that it is meant to be used internally within the project. \n\nHere is an example of how this trait may be used in a class:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.asyncfeaturemap.AsyncFeatureMap\n\nclass MyState(val asyncFeatureMap: AsyncFeatureMap) extends HasAsyncFeatureMap[MyState] {\n  override def addAsyncFeatureMap(newFeatureMap: AsyncFeatureMap): MyState = {\n    new MyState(asyncFeatureMap.merge(newFeatureMap))\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyState` is a class that extends `HasAsyncFeatureMap` and implements the required methods. The `asyncFeatureMap` method simply returns the `AsyncFeatureMap` instance passed in during instantiation. The `addAsyncFeatureMap` method creates a new instance of `MyState` with the merged `AsyncFeatureMap` passed in as a parameter. \n\nOverall, this trait provides a standardized way of handling states with `AsyncFeatureMap`s within the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `HasAsyncFeatureMap` trait?\n- The `HasAsyncFeatureMap` trait defines a contract for a class to have an `asyncFeatureMap` property and a method to add a new `AsyncFeatureMap` to the state.\n\n2. What is the `AsyncFeatureMap` class and how is it used in this code?\n- The `AsyncFeatureMap` class is likely a custom class defined elsewhere in the project. It is used as a property in the `HasAsyncFeatureMap` trait and can be added to the state using the `addAsyncFeatureMap` method.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `private[core]` access modifier in the `addAsyncFeatureMap` method?\n- The `private[core]` access modifier limits the visibility of the `addAsyncFeatureMap` method to the `core` package. This means that only classes within the `core` package can access and use this method, providing a level of encapsulation and control over the state."

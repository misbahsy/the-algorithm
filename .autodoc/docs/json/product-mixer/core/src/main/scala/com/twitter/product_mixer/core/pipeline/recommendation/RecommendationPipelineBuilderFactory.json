  "summary": "The `RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory` class is a factory for creating instances of `RecommendationPipelineBuilder`. This factory is responsible for creating and injecting all the necessary dependencies required to build a `RecommendationPipelineBuilder`. \n\nThe `RecommendationPipelineBuilder` is a pipeline that takes a `PipelineQuery` and returns a recommendation result. The pipeline consists of several stages, each of which is responsible for performing a specific task. The stages are as follows:\n\n1. `GateExecutor`: This stage is responsible for filtering out queries that do not meet certain criteria. For example, queries that are not relevant to the recommendation system may be filtered out.\n\n2. `SelectorExecutor`: This stage is responsible for selecting the most appropriate candidate items for the query. This is done by applying a set of rules to the query and the candidate items.\n\n3. `QueryFeatureHydratorExecutor`: This stage is responsible for adding features to the query. Features are additional pieces of information that can be used to improve the relevance of the recommendation.\n\n4. `AsyncFeatureMapExecutor`: This stage is responsible for adding features to the candidate items. Like the previous stage, this is done to improve the relevance of the recommendation.\n\n5. `CandidateFeatureHydratorExecutor`: This stage is responsible for adding additional features to the candidate items. These features are specific to the recommendation system and are used to improve the relevance of the recommendation.\n\n6. `FilterExecutor`: This stage is responsible for filtering out candidate items that do not meet certain criteria. For example, items that are not in stock may be filtered out.\n\n7. `ScoringPipelineExecutor`: This stage is responsible for scoring the candidate items based on their relevance to the query. This is done by applying a set of rules to the query and the candidate items.\n\n8. `CandidateDecoratorExecutor`: This stage is responsible for adding additional information to the candidate items. This information is specific to the recommendation system and is used to improve the relevance of the recommendation.\n\n9. `DomainMarshallerExecutor`: This stage is responsible for converting the candidate items into a format that can be used by the recommendation system.\n\n10. `TransportMarshallerExecutor`: This stage is responsible for converting the recommendation result into a format that can be transported over the network.\n\n11. `PipelineResultSideEffectExecutor`: This stage is responsible for performing any side effects that are required as a result of the recommendation. For example, updating the user's recommendation history.\n\nThe `RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory` class is responsible for creating an instance of `RecommendationPipelineBuilder` by injecting all the necessary dependencies. The `get` method of the `RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory` class returns an instance of `RecommendationPipelineBuilder` with all the necessary dependencies injected. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval recommendationPipelineBuilderFactory = new RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory(\n  candidatePipelineExecutor,\n  gateExecutor,\n  selectorExecutor,\n  queryFeatureHydratorExecutor,\n  asyncFeatureMapExecutor,\n  candidateFeatureHydratorExecutor,\n  filterExecutor,\n  scoringPipelineExecutor,\n  candidateDecoratorExecutor,\n  domainMarshallerExecutor,\n  transportMarshallerExecutor,\n  pipelineResultSideEffectExecutor,\n  candidatePipelineBuilderFactory,\n  scoringPipelineBuilderFactory,\n  statsReceiver\n)\n\nval recommendationPipelineBuilder = recommendationPipelineBuilderFactory.get[PipelineQuery, UniversalNoun[Any], HasMarshalling, Result]\n\nval recommendationResult = recommendationPipelineBuilder.execute(query)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory class that provides a builder for creating recommendation pipelines. The pipelines are used to generate recommendations based on a query and candidate items.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several other classes and interfaces, including StatsReceiver, PipelineQuery, UniversalNoun, HasMarshalling, CandidatePipelineBuilderFactory, ScoringPipelineBuilderFactory, and various executor classes.\n\n3. How is the RecommendationPipelineBuilder created and what parameters does it take?\n- The RecommendationPipelineBuilder is created by calling the get method on an instance of the RecommendationPipelineBuilderFactory class. The method takes four type parameters and several executor and factory instances as parameters."

  "summary": "This code defines a set of traits and classes for hydrating features for candidates in a product mixer pipeline. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to add features to candidates in a pipeline, which can then be used downstream in other APIs. \n\nThe `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait is a sealed trait that defines a base feature hydrator for a single candidate. It takes in a query, a result, and a feature type, and extends the `FeatureHydrator` trait and the `SupportsConditionally` trait. The `CandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides an implementation for hydrating a single candidate at a time. It takes in a query and a candidate, and returns a `Stitch` of `FeatureMap`. The `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides a way to hydrate features for a list of candidates. It takes in a query and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures`, and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `FeatureMap`. Finally, the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait extends `BaseBulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` and provides an implementation for hydrating features for all candidates at once. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to add features to candidates in a product mixer pipeline, which can then be used downstream in other APIs. For example, if the candidate is a tweet, a feature could be whether it's marked as sensitive. This feature can then be used downstream in other APIs to filter out sensitive tweets. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// Define a candidate feature hydrator for tweets\nobject TweetFeatureHydrator extends CandidateFeatureHydrator[TweetQuery, Tweet] {\n  override val identifier: FeatureHydratorIdentifier = FeatureHydratorIdentifier(\"tweet_feature_hydrator\")\n\n  override def apply(query: TweetQuery, candidate: Tweet, existingFeatures: FeatureMap): Stitch[FeatureMap] = {\n    // Add a feature for whether the tweet is sensitive\n    val isSensitive = candidate.isSensitive\n    existingFeatures.addFeature(\"is_sensitive\", isSensitive)\n  }\n}\n\n// Define a bulk candidate feature hydrator for tweets\nobject BulkTweetFeatureHydrator extends BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator[TweetQuery, Tweet] {\n  override val identifier: FeatureHydratorIdentifier = FeatureHydratorIdentifier(\"bulk_tweet_feature_hydrator\")\n\n  override def apply(query: TweetQuery, candidates: Seq[CandidateWithFeatures[Tweet]]): Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]] = {\n    // Add a feature for the visibility reason of each tweet\n    val visibilityReasons = candidates.map(candidate => candidate.features.addFeature(\"visibility_reason\", candidate.visibilityReason))\n    Stitch.sequence(visibilityReasons)\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines traits and classes for hydrating features for candidates in a product mixer pipeline. It solves the problem of efficiently adding features to candidates in a scalable way.\n\n2. What is the difference between CandidateFeatureHydrator and BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator?\n- CandidateFeatureHydrator hydrates features for a single candidate at a time, while BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator hydrates features for a list of candidates at once.\n\n3. What is the role of SupportsConditionally and how is it used?\n- SupportsConditionally is a trait that allows a feature hydrator to be conditionally run based on a query. It is used as a mixin to BaseCandidateFeatureHydrator to enable conditional gating of feature hydrators."

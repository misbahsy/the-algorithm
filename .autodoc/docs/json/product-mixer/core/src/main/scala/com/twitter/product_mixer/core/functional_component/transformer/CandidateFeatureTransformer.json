  "summary": "The code defines a trait called CandidateFeatureTransformer that is used to populate a FeatureMap with Features that are available in the CandidateSourceResult. This trait extends another trait called FeatureTransformer, which is not defined in this file. \n\nA FeatureMap is a data structure that maps feature names to their values. It is used to represent the features of a product or candidate. The CandidateSourceResult is a result of a candidate source, which is a source of candidates for a product. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to transform a CandidateSourceResult into a FeatureMap. This can be useful in a larger project that involves product mixing or recommendation systems. For example, if we have a set of candidate products for a user, we can use this trait to extract the features of each candidate and create a FeatureMap for each one. We can then use these FeatureMaps to compare the candidates and recommend the best one to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how this trait can be used:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap\n\n// Define a case class for a candidate product\ncase class CandidateProduct(name: String, price: Double, rating: Double)\n\n// Define a CandidateSourceResult\nval candidates = Seq(\n  CandidateProduct(\"Product A\", 10.0, 4.5),\n  CandidateProduct(\"Product B\", 20.0, 3.8),\n  CandidateProduct(\"Product C\", 15.0, 4.2)\n)\n\n// Define a class that extends CandidateFeatureTransformer and implements the transform method\nclass MyCandidateFeatureTransformer extends CandidateFeatureTransformer[CandidateProduct] {\n  override def transform(candidate: CandidateProduct): FeatureMap = {\n    val featureMap = new FeatureMap()\n    featureMap.set(\"price\", candidate.price)\n    featureMap.set(\"rating\", candidate.rating)\n    featureMap\n  }\n}\n\n// Use the transformer to create FeatureMaps for each candidate\nval transformer = new MyCandidateFeatureTransformer()\nval featureMaps = candidates.map(transformer.transform)\n\n// Print the FeatureMaps\nfeatureMaps.foreach(println)\n```\n\nThis code creates a sequence of CandidateProducts and defines a class called MyCandidateFeatureTransformer that extends CandidateFeatureTransformer and implements the transform method. The transform method creates a FeatureMap for each candidate and sets the \"price\" and \"rating\" features. The code then uses the transformer to create FeatureMaps for each candidate and prints them.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CandidateFeatureTransformer` trait?\n   \n   The `CandidateFeatureTransformer` trait is used to populate a `FeatureMap` with features that are available in the `CandidateSourceResult`.\n\n2. What is the relationship between `CandidateFeatureTransformer` and `FeatureTransformer`?\n   \n   `CandidateFeatureTransformer` extends the `FeatureTransformer` trait, which means that it inherits all the methods and properties of `FeatureTransformer`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `-CandidateSourceResult` type parameter in the trait definition?\n   \n   The `-CandidateSourceResult` type parameter indicates that `CandidateSourceResult` is a contravariant type parameter, which means that a `CandidateFeatureTransformer` can accept a supertype of `CandidateSourceResult`."

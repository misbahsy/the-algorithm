  "summary": "The code defines a case class called `FilterResult` that is used to represent the result of applying a filter to a sequence of candidates. The `FilterResult` contains two sequences: `kept` and `removed`, which respectively represent the candidates that passed and failed the filter. \n\nThis code is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing large amounts of data. The `FilterResult` class is likely used in conjunction with other functional components to filter and process data. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval candidates: Seq[Candidate] = // some sequence of candidates\nval filter: Filter[Candidate] = // some filter to apply to the candidates\n\nval filterResult: FilterResult[Candidate] = filter.apply(candidates)\nval keptCandidates: Seq[Candidate] = filterResult.kept\nval removedCandidates: Seq[Candidate] = filterResult.removed\n\n// do something with the kept and removed candidates\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a sequence of `Candidate` objects and a `Filter` object that we want to apply to the candidates. We call the `apply` method on the `Filter` object, passing in the sequence of candidates. This returns a `FilterResult` object that contains the candidates that passed and failed the filter. We can then access these sequences using the `kept` and `removed` properties of the `FilterResult` object and do something with them. \n\nOverall, the `FilterResult` class is a useful tool for processing large amounts of data and filtering out unwanted candidates.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Filter` class that is mentioned in the code?\n   - The code mentions a `Filter` class, but it is not defined in this file. A smart developer might wonder what the purpose of this class is and how it relates to the `FilterResult` case class.\n   \n2. What is the significance of the `+` symbol before the `Candidate` type parameter in the `FilterResult` case class?\n   - The `+` symbol indicates that the `Candidate` type parameter is covariant. A smart developer might want to know why this is important and how it affects the usage of the `FilterResult` class.\n\n3. How is the `FilterResult` class used in the larger context of the project?\n   - The code only defines the `FilterResult` case class, but it doesn't show how it is used in the rest of the project. A smart developer might want to know where and how this class is used, and what other components it interacts with."

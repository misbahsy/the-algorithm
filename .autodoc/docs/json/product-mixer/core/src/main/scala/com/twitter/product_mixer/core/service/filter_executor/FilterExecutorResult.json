  "summary": "The code defines classes and traits related to filtering candidates in a product mixer service. The `FilterExecutorResult` case class is used to represent the result of executing a filter on a sequence of candidates. It contains two fields: `result`, which is a sequence of candidates that passed the filter, and `individualFilterResults`, which is a sequence of `IndividualFilterResults` objects that provide information about the execution of each individual filter.\n\nThe `IndividualFilterResults` trait is a sealed trait that defines the possible types of individual filter results. It is used as a base trait for two case classes: `ConditionalFilterDisabled` and `FilterExecutorIndividualResult`. The former is used to represent the case where a filter was disabled due to a condition not being met, and the latter is used to represent the result of executing a filter on a sequence of candidates. It contains three fields: `identifier`, which is the identifier of the filter that was executed, `kept`, which is a sequence of candidates that passed the filter, and `removed`, which is a sequence of candidates that failed the filter.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger product mixer service to filter candidates based on various criteria. The `FilterExecutorResult` class provides a convenient way to represent the results of executing multiple filters on a sequence of candidates, while the `IndividualFilterResults` trait and its subclasses provide detailed information about the execution of each individual filter. This information can be used to debug and optimize the filtering process. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval candidates: Seq[Candidate] = Seq(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\nval filter1: Filter[Candidate] = new SomeFilter()\nval filter2: Filter[Candidate] = new AnotherFilter()\n\nval filtered1: Seq[Candidate] = filter1.filter(candidates)\nval filtered2: Seq[Candidate] = filter2.filter(candidates)\n\nval result: FilterExecutorResult[Candidate] = FilterExecutorResult(\n  result = filtered2,\n  individualFilterResults = Seq(\n    FilterExecutorIndividualResult(\n      identifier = filter1.identifier,\n      kept = filtered1,\n      removed = candidates.diff(filtered1)\n    ),\n    FilterExecutorIndividualResult(\n      identifier = filter2.identifier,\n      kept = filtered2,\n      removed = candidates.diff(filtered2)\n    )\n  )\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?\n- This code defines case classes and traits related to filtering candidates in a product mixer service. A smart developer might want to know how these classes are used in the larger project and what other components interact with them.\n\n2. What is the difference between `FilterExecutorResult` and `IndividualFilterResults`?\n- `FilterExecutorResult` is a case class that contains a sequence of candidates and a sequence of `IndividualFilterResults`. `IndividualFilterResults` is a sealed trait that defines different types of results that can be returned by individual filters. A smart developer might want to know how these two classes are related and how they are used in the filtering process.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `FilterIdentifier` class and how is it used in this code?\n- `FilterIdentifier` is a class that represents a unique identifier for a filter. It is used in `ConditionalFilterDisabled` and `FilterExecutorIndividualResult` to identify the filter that returned the result. A smart developer might want to know how `FilterIdentifier` is instantiated and passed to these classes, and how it is used in the filtering process."

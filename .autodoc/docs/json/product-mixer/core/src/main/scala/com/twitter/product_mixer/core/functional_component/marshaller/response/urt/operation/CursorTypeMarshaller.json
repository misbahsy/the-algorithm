  "summary": "The `CursorTypeMarshaller` class is responsible for converting between the `CursorType` enumeration used in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.operation` package and the `CursorType` enumeration used in the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package. This conversion is necessary because the two packages are used in different parts of the larger project and need to communicate with each other.\n\nThe `apply` method takes a `CursorType` value from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.operation` package and returns the corresponding `CursorType` value from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package. This method is used when converting a response from one part of the project to another.\n\nThe `unmarshall` method does the opposite: it takes a `CursorType` value from the `com.twitter.timelines.render.thriftscala` package and returns the corresponding `CursorType` value from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.operation` package. This method is used when converting a request from one part of the project to another.\n\nBoth methods use pattern matching to match the input value to the correct output value. If an unexpected value is encountered, an exception is thrown.\n\nThis class is annotated with `@Singleton` and `@Inject`, indicating that it is a dependency that can be injected into other classes using a dependency injection framework. This allows other parts of the project to use this class without having to create a new instance every time it is needed.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval marshaller = new CursorTypeMarshaller()\nval cursorType = TopCursor\nval thriftCursorType = marshaller(cursorType) // returns urt.CursorType.Top\n\nval unmarshaller = new CursorTypeMarshaller()\nval thriftCursorType = urt.CursorType.Top\nval cursorType = unmarshaller.unmarshall(thriftCursorType) // returns TopCursor\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a CursorTypeMarshaller class that converts between CursorType and urt.CursorType.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the apply method?\n- The input of the apply method is a CursorType object, and the output is a urt.CursorType object.\n\n3. What happens if an unexpected cursor enum field is encountered in the unmarshall method?\n- If an unexpected cursor enum field is encountered in the unmarshall method, an UnsupportedOperationException is thrown with a message indicating the unexpected field ID."

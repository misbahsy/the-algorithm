  "summary": "This code defines the AccessPolicy trait and two case classes that implement it: AllowedLdapGroups and BlockEverything. AccessPolicy is used to set the access policy for querying in the turntable tool. AllowedLdapGroups specifies that users must be in at least one of the provided LDAP groups in order to make a query. BlockEverything blocks all requests to a product. \n\nThe code uses Jackson annotations to specify how the classes should be serialized and deserialized. Specifically, it uses @JsonTypeInfo to indicate that the type information should be included in the serialized JSON, and @JsonSubTypes to specify the subtypes that should be included. \n\nAllowedLdapGroups takes a Set of LDAP groups as a parameter, and also provides a convenience method that takes a single group and creates a Set with that group. BlockEverything is an empty case class that is used to indicate that all requests should be blocked. \n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to define and enforce access policies for the turntable tool. It allows for flexible configuration of access policies, and the use of case classes makes it easy to define new policies as needed. The Jackson annotations ensure that the policies can be serialized and deserialized correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval policy = AllowedLdapGroups(Set(\"group1\", \"group2\"))\nval json = ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(policy)\n// json is {\"AllowedLdapGroups\":{\"groups\":[\"group1\",\"group2\"]}}\n\nval deserialized = ObjectMapper().readValue(json, AccessPolicy::class.java)\n// deserialized is an instance of AllowedLdapGroups with groups set to [\"group1\", \"group2\"]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an Access Policy for gating querying in the turntable tool, with two possible implementations: AllowedLdapGroups and BlockEverything.\n\n2. What is the significance of the @JsonTypeInfo and @JsonSubTypes annotations?\n- These annotations are used for JSON serialization and deserialization, and allow the correct subtype to be identified when reading JSON data.\n\n3. Why is BlockEverything defined as a case class instead of an object?\n- BlockEverything is defined as a case class because classOf doesn't work on objects, and JsonSubTypes requires the annotation argument to be a constant. This issue may be resolved in Scala 2.13."

  "summary": "The `MediaMarshaller` class is responsible for converting a `Media` object from the core model into a `urt.Media` object from the `timelines.render` package. This conversion is necessary for the media data to be properly displayed in the user's timeline.\n\nThe class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. It is also injected with four other marshaller classes: `MediaEntityMarshaller`, `MediaKeyMarshaller`, `RectMarshaller`, and `AspectRatioMarshaller`.\n\nThe `apply` method takes a `Media` object as input and returns a `urt.Media` object. It maps the fields of the `Media` object to the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object using the injected marshaller classes. Specifically, it maps the `mediaEntity`, `mediaKey`, `imagePossibleCropping`, and `aspectRatio` fields.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `MediaMarshaller` class:\n\n```\nval media = Media(\n  mediaEntity = Some(MediaEntity(...)),\n  mediaKey = Some(MediaKey(...)),\n  imagePossibleCropping = Some(Seq(Rect(...), Rect(...))),\n  aspectRatio = Some(AspectRatio(...))\n)\n\nval mediaMarshaller = new MediaMarshaller(\n  new MediaEntityMarshaller(),\n  new MediaKeyMarshaller(),\n  new RectMarshaller(),\n  new AspectRatioMarshaller()\n)\n\nval urtMedia = mediaMarshaller(media)\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Media` object is created with some sample data. Then, a new instance of `MediaMarshaller` is created with the necessary injected marshaller classes. Finally, the `apply` method is called with the `Media` object as input, returning a `urt.Media` object.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code is a Scala class that marshals a `Media` object into a `urt.Media` object. It uses several other marshaller classes to convert the different fields of the `Media` object into the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this class and how are they injected?\n   - This class has four dependencies: `MediaEntityMarshaller`, `MediaKeyMarshaller`, `RectMarshaller`, and `AspectRatioMarshaller`. They are injected into the class constructor using the `@Inject` annotation and the class is marked as a `@Singleton`.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?\n   - The `apply` method takes a `Media` object as input and returns a `urt.Media` object. It maps the fields of the `Media` object to the corresponding fields of the `urt.Media` object using the marshaller classes. The returned `urt.Media` object may have some fields set to `None` if the corresponding fields in the `Media` object are not present."

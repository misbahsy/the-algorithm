  "summary": "The code defines a case class called TombstoneInfo, which is used to represent information about a tombstone item in a response from the Twitter product mixer API. A tombstone item is an object that represents a deleted or removed item in a list or feed. \n\nThe TombstoneInfo case class has three fields: text, richText, and richRevealText. The text field is a string that contains the text of the tombstone item. The richText field is an optional field that contains rich text formatting information for the tombstone item. The richRevealText field is also an optional field that contains rich text formatting information for the tombstone item, but it is specifically used for revealing the deleted content in a feed or list.\n\nThis code is part of a larger project that involves the Twitter product mixer API, which is used to combine and filter content from various sources on Twitter. The TombstoneInfo case class is used in the response from the API when a tombstone item is encountered. The information in the TombstoneInfo object can be used by client applications to display the tombstone item in a user-friendly way, including any rich text formatting that may be present.\n\nHere is an example of how the TombstoneInfo case class might be used in a client application:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.item.tombstone.TombstoneInfo\n\nval tombstone = TombstoneInfo(\"This item has been deleted.\", Some(RichText(\"This item has been <b>deleted</b>.\")), None)\n\nprintln(tombstone.text) // Output: This item has been deleted.\nprintln(tombstone.richText.get.text) // Output: This item has been <b>deleted</b>.\n``` \n\nIn this example, a TombstoneInfo object is created with the text \"This item has been deleted.\" and a rich text formatting of \"This item has been <b>deleted</b>.\". The tombstone object is then printed to the console, showing how the TombstoneInfo case class can be used to represent tombstone items in a response from the Twitter product mixer API.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the TombstoneInfo case class?\n- The TombstoneInfo case class is used to represent information about a tombstone item in a response from the product mixer core model.\n\n2. What is the difference between the richText and richRevealText options?\n- The richText option represents the rich text content of the tombstone item, while the richRevealText option represents the rich text content that should be revealed when the tombstone item is clicked.\n\n3. What other classes or packages are imported in this file?\n- This file imports the RichText class from the com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.response.urt.richtext package."

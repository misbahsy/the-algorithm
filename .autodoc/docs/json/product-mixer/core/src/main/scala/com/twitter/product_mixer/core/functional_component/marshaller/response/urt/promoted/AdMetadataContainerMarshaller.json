  "summary": "The `AdMetadataContainerMarshaller` class is responsible for marshalling an `AdMetadataContainer` object into a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. This class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter, which likely involves processing and displaying advertisements.\n\nThe `AdMetadataContainer` object contains metadata about an advertisement, such as the sponsorship organization and type, as well as data related to Apple's SKAdNetwork framework. The `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object is a Thrift-generated class that represents the same data in a format that can be easily serialized and deserialized.\n\nThe `apply` method takes an `AdMetadataContainer` object as input and returns a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. The method maps the fields of the input object to the corresponding fields of the output object. Some fields require additional processing, such as mapping the `sponsorshipType` and `disclaimerType` fields using the `SponsorshipTypeMarshaller` and `DisclaimerTypeMarshaller` classes, respectively.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to convert `AdMetadataContainer` objects into a format that can be easily transmitted and stored. For example, the `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object may be serialized and sent over a network to be stored in a database or displayed to a user.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval adMetadataContainer = AdMetadataContainer(\n  removePromotedAttributionForPreroll = true,\n  sponsorshipCandidate = \"Acme Corp\",\n  sponsorshipOrganization = \"Acme Corp\",\n  sponsorshipOrganizationWebsite = \"https://acme.com\",\n  sponsorshipType = Some(SponsorshipType.PROMOTED),\n  disclaimerType = Some(DisclaimerType.SPONSORED),\n  skAdNetworkDataList = Some(Seq(SkAdNetworkData(\n    version = 2,\n    network = \"abcd1234.defg5678\",\n    campaign = \"123456\",\n    itunesItem = \"987654321\"\n  ))),\n  unifiedCardOverride = None\n)\n\nval marshaller = new AdMetadataContainerMarshaller(\n  new SponsorshipTypeMarshaller(),\n  new DisclaimerTypeMarshaller(),\n  new SkAdNetworkDataMarshaller()\n)\n\nval urtAdMetadataContainer = marshaller(adMetadataContainer)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code is a Scala class that marshals an `AdMetadataContainer` object into a `urt.AdMetadataContainer` object. It uses several other marshaller classes to convert the fields of the input object into the appropriate format for the output object.\n   \n2. What are the dependencies of this class?\n   - This class depends on three other marshaller classes: `SponsorshipTypeMarshaller`, `DisclaimerTypeMarshaller`, and `SkAdNetworkDataMarshaller`. These classes are injected into the constructor of `AdMetadataContainerMarshaller`.\n   \n3. What is the scope of this class?\n   - This class is annotated with `@Singleton`, which means that only one instance of it will be created and shared across the application. This suggests that it is intended to be used as a shared utility class rather than a class that is instantiated multiple times."

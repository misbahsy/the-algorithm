  "summary": "This code defines two traits, `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures`, which are used to represent sources of potential content for a larger system. Both traits extend a common trait, `BaseCandidateSource`, which defines a `CandidateSourceIdentifier` that identifies the source of the content.\n\nThe `CandidateSource` trait defines a method `apply` that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `Candidate` objects. The `Request` object is used to specify any arguments needed to retrieve the potential content. The `Stitch` class is a Twitter library that provides a way to compose asynchronous operations. The sequence of `Candidate` objects represents the potential content that the source can provide.\n\nThe `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` trait extends `BaseCandidateSource` and defines a method `apply` that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Stitch` of a `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object. The `CandidatesWithSourceFeatures` object contains a sequence of `Candidate` objects and a map of extracted features from the source. This is useful for sources that return features that may be useful later on without needing to re-hydrate them.\n\nOverall, these traits provide a way to define sources of potential content that can be used in a larger system. The `CandidateSource` trait is used for sources that only return potential content, while the `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` trait is used for sources that also return extracted features. These traits can be implemented by other classes to provide specific sources of content for the larger system. For example, a `TwitterCandidateSource` class could implement the `CandidateSource` trait to provide potential content from Twitter. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// Define a candidate source that returns potential content from a database\nclass DatabaseCandidateSource extends CandidateSource[DatabaseRequest, DatabaseCandidate] {\n  val identifier = CandidateSourceIdentifier(\"database\")\n\n  def apply(request: DatabaseRequest): Stitch[Seq[DatabaseCandidate]] = {\n    // retrieve potential content from the database using the request\n    // and return it as a sequence wrapped in a Stitch\n  }\n}\n\n// Define a candidate source that returns potential content and extracted features from a web service\nclass WebServiceCandidateSource extends CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures[WebServiceRequest, WebServiceCandidate] {\n  val identifier = CandidateSourceIdentifier(\"web_service\")\n\n  def apply(request: WebServiceRequest): Stitch[CandidatesWithSourceFeatures[WebServiceCandidate]] = {\n    // retrieve potential content and extracted features from the web service using the request\n    // and return it as a CandidatesWithSourceFeatures object wrapped in a Stitch\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BaseCandidateSource` trait and how is it related to the `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` traits?\n- The `BaseCandidateSource` trait is a common trait shared by both `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` traits, and it defines a `val` property called `identifier` of type `CandidateSourceIdentifier`. The purpose of this trait is to provide a common interface for candidate sources to be used in the product mixer. \n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Stitch` class and how is it used in the `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` traits?\n- The `Stitch` class is used to represent a computation that may fail with an error or produce a value of type `A`. It is used in the `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` traits to wrap the result of the `apply` method, which returns a `Seq` of potential content. \n\n3. What is the difference between `CandidateSource` and `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` traits?\n- The `CandidateSource` trait returns a `Seq` of potential content, while the `CandidateSourceWithExtractedFeatures` trait returns a result containing both a `Seq` of potential candidates as well as an extracted feature map that will later be appended to the pipeline's feature map. This is useful for candidate sources that return features that might be useful later on without needing to re-hydrate them."

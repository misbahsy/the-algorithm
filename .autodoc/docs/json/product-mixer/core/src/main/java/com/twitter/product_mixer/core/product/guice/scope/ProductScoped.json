  "summary": "This code defines a custom Guice scope annotation called `ProductScoped`. Guice is a dependency injection framework for Java, and custom scopes can be defined to control the lifecycle of objects managed by Guice. \n\nThe `@ScopeAnnotation` annotation indicates that this is a Guice scope annotation. The `@Target` annotation specifies that this annotation can be applied to both types (classes and interfaces) and methods. The `@Retention` annotation specifies that this annotation should be retained at runtime, so that it can be accessed via reflection.\n\nIn the larger project, this custom scope annotation can be used to define the lifecycle of objects related to products. For example, if the project has a `Product` class, instances of that class can be annotated with `@ProductScoped` to indicate that they should be created and managed by Guice within the context of a product. This can be useful for managing resources related to a product, such as database connections or caches.\n\nHere is an example of how this annotation might be used:\n\n```\n@ProductScoped\npublic class ProductCache {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `ProductCache` is a class that manages a cache of product data. By annotating it with `@ProductScoped`, we indicate that a separate instance of `ProductCache` should be created for each product, and that these instances should be managed by Guice. This ensures that each product has its own cache, and that the cache is cleaned up when the product is no longer needed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this annotation?\n   This annotation is used to define a custom scope for objects managed by Guice dependency injection in the context of the Product Mixer project at Twitter.\n\n2. How is this annotation used in the project?\n   This annotation is likely used to annotate classes or methods that should be instantiated as singletons within the custom scope defined by the ProductScoped annotation.\n\n3. Are there any other custom scopes defined in the project?\n   Without further context, it is impossible to determine if there are other custom scopes defined in the project. However, it is possible that other annotations similar to ProductScoped may exist for other parts of the application."

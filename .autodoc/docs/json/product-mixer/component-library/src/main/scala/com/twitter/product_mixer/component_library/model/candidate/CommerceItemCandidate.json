  "summary": "The code defines two classes, `CommerceProductCandidate` and `CommerceProductGroupCandidate`, which are models for encapsulating information about specific products and product groups, respectively. These classes extend the `UniversalNoun` class and take a single parameter, `id`, which is a `Long` representing the unique identifier for the product or product group.\n\nThe purpose of these classes is to provide a canonical representation of products and product groups that can be used throughout the larger project. The documentation notes that these classes should always be preferred over other variants, such as those that include additional fields, and that they can be shown in the same `TimelineModule` (i.e. carousel).\n\nThe `CommerceProductCandidate` class includes an implementation of the `equals` method that leverages referential equality and cached hashcode equality to provide high performance. The `hashCode` is cached as a `val` on object construction to prevent the need to recompute it on each `hashCode()` invocation. The documentation notes that the `hashCode` should only be cached if all of the fields used to construct it are immutable.\n\nThe `CommerceProductGroupCandidate` class is similar to the `CommerceProductCandidate` class, but represents a product group rather than a specific product. It also includes an implementation of the `equals` method and a cached `hashCode`.\n\nThe documentation notes that both classes should always remain `final`, and that if the `final` modifier is removed, the `equals` implementation must be updated to handle class inheritor equality.\n\nOverall, these classes provide a standardized way to represent products and product groups in the larger project, and their implementations of `equals` and `hashCode` ensure high performance and consistency with object equality. An example of creating a `CommerceProductCandidate` object would be:\n\n```\nval product = CommerceProductCandidate(12345)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CommerceProductCandidate` and `CommerceProductGroupCandidate` classes?\n- The `CommerceProductCandidate` class encapsulates information about a specific product, while the `CommerceProductGroupCandidate` class encapsulates information about a single product type and its corresponding versions.\n\n2. How should additional fields be added to a candidate's feature map?\n- Additional fields should be added as a `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.Feature` on the candidate's feature map.\n\n3. Why should the `hashCode` of a candidate be cached as a `val`?\n- The `hashCode` of a candidate should be cached as a `val` to prevent the need to recompute the `hashCode` on each `hashCode()` invocation, which is the behavior of the Scala compiler case class-generated `hashCode()`. This is only safe if all of the fields used to construct the `hashCode` are immutable."

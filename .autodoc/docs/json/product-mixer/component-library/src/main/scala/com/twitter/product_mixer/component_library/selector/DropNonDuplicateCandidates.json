  "summary": "The `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class is a selector component that is used to filter out non-duplicate candidates from a list of candidates. The purpose of this component is to keep only the candidates in `remainingCandidates` that appear multiple times. This is done by identifying and keeping candidates using the supplied key extraction and merger functions. By default, this will keep only candidates that appear multiple times as determined by comparing the contained candidate ID and class type. Candidates appearing only once will be dropped. \n\nThe `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class takes in a `pipelineScope` and a `duplicationKey` as parameters. The `pipelineScope` is an instance of `CandidateScope` and the `duplicationKey` is an instance of `DeduplicationKey[_]`. The `duplicationKey` is used to generate the key used to identify duplicate candidates. \n\nThe `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class has an `apply` method that takes in a `PipelineQuery`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result` as parameters. The `remainingCandidates` parameter is a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects that need to be filtered. The `apply` method calls the `dropNonDuplicates` method to filter out non-duplicate candidates from the `remainingCandidates` sequence. The `dropNonDuplicates` method takes in the `pipelineScope`, `candidates`, and `duplicationKey` as parameters. It then checks if each candidate has multiple appearances or not and returns a sequence of candidates that have multiple appearances. \n\nThe `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class also has a `private` method called `dropNonDuplicates` that takes in the `pipelineScope`, `candidates`, and `duplicationKey` as parameters. This method is used to identify and keep candidates using the supplied key extraction and merger functions. By default, this will keep only candidates that appear multiple times as determined by comparing the contained candidate ID and class type. Candidates appearing only once will be dropped. \n\nThe `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class has a `case class` signature, which means that it can be instantiated with the `new` keyword. An example of how to use this class is shown below:\n\n```\nval dropNonDuplicateCandidates = new DropNonDuplicateCandidates(pipelineScope, duplicationKey)\nval remainingCandidates = Seq(sourceA_Id1, sourceA_Id1, sourceA_Id2, sourceB_id1, sourceB_id2, sourceB_id3, sourceC_id4)\nval result = Seq()\nval selectorResult = dropNonDuplicateCandidates.apply(pipelineQuery, remainingCandidates, result)\n```\n\nIn the example above, we create a new instance of the `DropNonDuplicateCandidates` class and pass in the `pipelineScope` and `duplicationKey` parameters. We then create a sequence of `remainingCandidates` and an empty sequence of `result`. We then call the `apply` method on the `dropNonDuplicateCandidates` instance and pass in the `pipelineQuery`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result` parameters. The `apply` method returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the filtered `remainingCandidates` sequence and the `result` sequence.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?\n- This code is a Scala case class that drops non-duplicate candidates from a sequence of candidates. It is part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer` package and is used in the project's pipeline.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. It returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the remaining duplicate candidates and the original result.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `dropNonDuplicates` method and how does it work?\n- The `dropNonDuplicates` method identifies and keeps candidates using a key extraction and merger function. By default, it keeps only candidates that appear multiple times. It does this by checking if each candidate has multiple appearances or not, and then filtering out the non-duplicate candidates. The method takes in a `CandidateScope`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a `DeduplicationKey` object."

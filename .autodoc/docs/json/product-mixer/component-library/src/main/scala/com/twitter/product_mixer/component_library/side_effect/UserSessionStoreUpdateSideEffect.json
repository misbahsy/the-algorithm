  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `UserSessionStoreUpdateSideEffect` which extends the `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait. This trait is used to write data to a `ReadWriteUserSessionStore` after a pipeline query has been executed. \n\nThe `UserSessionStoreUpdateSideEffect` trait has a type parameter `Request` which extends `WriteRequest`, a type parameter `Query` which extends `PipelineQuery`, and a type parameter `ResponseType` which extends `HasMarshalling`. These type parameters are used to define the types of the inputs and outputs of the pipeline query.\n\nThe trait has a method called `buildWriteRequest` which takes a `Query` object as input and returns an `Option[Request]`. This method is used to build a `WriteRequest` object from the `Query` object. If the `buildWriteRequest` method returns `None`, then no data is written to the `ReadWriteUserSessionStore`.\n\nThe trait also has a `userSessionStore` field of type `ReadWriteUserSessionStore`. This field is used to specify the user session store to which the data will be written.\n\nThe `apply` method of the trait takes an `Inputs` object as input, which contains the `Query` object and the result of the pipeline query. The `buildWriteRequest` method is called with the `Query` object to build a `WriteRequest` object. If the `buildWriteRequest` method returns `Some(request)`, then the `write` method of the `userSessionStore` is called with the `request` object to write the data to the user session store. If the `buildWriteRequest` method returns `None`, then no data is written to the user session store.\n\nThis trait can be used in a larger project to write data to a user session store after a pipeline query has been executed. For example, if the project involves processing user data, this trait can be used to write the processed data to a user session store for future use. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass MyPipelineQuery extends PipelineQuery {\n  // implementation\n}\n\nclass MyWriteRequest extends WriteRequest {\n  // implementation\n}\n\nclass MyResponseType extends HasMarshalling {\n  // implementation\n}\n\nclass MyUserSessionStore extends ReadWriteUserSessionStore {\n  // implementation\n}\n\nclass MySideEffect extends UserSessionStoreUpdateSideEffect[MyWriteRequest, MyPipelineQuery, MyResponseType] {\n  val userSessionStore: MyUserSessionStore = new MyUserSessionStore()\n\n  def buildWriteRequest(query: MyPipelineQuery): Option[MyWriteRequest] = {\n    // implementation\n  }\n}\n\nval myQuery = new MyPipelineQuery()\nval mySideEffect = new MySideEffect()\n\n// execute pipeline query\nval result = executePipelineQuery(myQuery)\n\n// write result to user session store\nmySideEffect.apply(PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs(myQuery, result))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project? \n- This code defines a trait for a PipelineResultSideEffect that writes to a ReadWriteUserSessionStore. It is likely used as part of a larger pipeline system for processing data.\n\n2. What are the input and output types for this trait? \n- The trait takes in a PipelineQuery and outputs a type that extends HasMarshalling. It also requires a WriteRequest type as a generic parameter.\n\n3. How does the apply method work and what does it return? \n- The apply method takes in inputs of type PipelineResultSideEffect.Inputs and returns a Stitch[Unit]. It builds a write request from the query and writes it to the userSessionStore, or returns Stitch.Unit if the write request is not valid."

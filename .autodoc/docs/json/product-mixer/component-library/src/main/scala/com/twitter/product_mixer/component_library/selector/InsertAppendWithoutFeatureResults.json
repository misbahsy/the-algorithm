  "summary": "The code defines a selector component for a product mixing pipeline. The purpose of this selector is to append all candidates missing a specific feature to the results pool and keep the rest in the remaining candidates. This is useful for backfill scoring candidates without a score from a previous scorer. \n\nThe `InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults` class takes two parameters: `pipelineScope` and `missingFeature`. `pipelineScope` is the pipeline scope to check, and `missingFeature` is the missing feature to check for. The class extends the `Selector` trait, which defines a method `apply` that takes three parameters: `query`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result`. \n\nThe `apply` method partitions the `remainingCandidates` into two groups: `candidatesWithMissingFeature` and `candidatesWithFeature`. The `candidatesWithMissingFeature` group contains candidates that are missing the `missingFeature` feature, while the `candidatesWithFeature` group contains candidates that have the `missingFeature` feature. The method then appends the `candidatesWithMissingFeature` to the `result` pool and returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result` pools.\n\nThis selector can be used in a larger product mixing pipeline to ensure that all candidates are scored, even if they are missing a specific feature. For example, if a previous scorer did not score candidates that are missing a certain feature, this selector can be used to append those candidates to the results pool and ensure that they are scored by a subsequent scorer. \n\nHere is an example of how this selector can be used in a product mixing pipeline:\n\n```\nval pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq(\"feature1\", \"feature2\"))\nval missingFeature = Feature[String, String](\"feature3\")\nval selector = InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults(pipelineScope, missingFeature)\n\nval query = PipelineQuery(Seq(\"query1\", \"query2\"))\nval remainingCandidates = Seq(\n  CandidateWithDetails(Seq(\"feature1\", \"feature2\"), Map(\"feature3\" -> \"value1\")),\n  CandidateWithDetails(Seq(\"feature1\", \"feature2\"), Map(\"feature3\" -> \"value2\")),\n  CandidateWithDetails(Seq(\"feature1\", \"feature2\"), Map(\"feature4\" -> \"value3\"))\n)\nval result = Seq(\n  CandidateWithDetails(Seq(\"feature1\", \"feature2\"), Map(\"feature3\" -> \"value3\"))\n)\n\nval selectorResult = selector.apply(query, remainingCandidates, result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pipelineScope` contains two features: \"feature1\" and \"feature2\". The `missingFeature` is \"feature3\". The `remainingCandidates` contains three candidates, one of which is missing \"feature3\". The `result` contains one candidate that already has \"feature3\". The `selector` is then applied to the `query`, `remainingCandidates`, and `result` to obtain a `selectorResult` that contains the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result` pools.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?\n- This code defines a selector that appends candidates missing a specific feature to the results pool and keeps the rest in the remaining candidates. It is used in the product mixer component library for backfill scoring candidates without a score from a previous scorer.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing current results. It outputs a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated remaining candidates and results.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `missingFeature` parameter in the `InsertAppendWithoutFeatureResults` case class?\n- The `missingFeature` parameter specifies the feature that is missing from candidates that should be appended to the results pool."

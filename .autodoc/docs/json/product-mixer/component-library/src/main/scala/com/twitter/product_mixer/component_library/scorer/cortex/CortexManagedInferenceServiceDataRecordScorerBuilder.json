  "summary": "The `CortexManagedInferenceServiceDataRecordScorerBuilder` class is a part of the Twitter Algorithm project and is responsible for building a configurable Scorer to call into a desired DataRecord-backed Cortex Managed ML Model Service. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to build a Scorer that can be used to score candidates based on a given model. \n\nThe class takes in an `Http.Client` object and uses it to build a Scorer object. The `build` method takes in several parameters, including a unique identifier for the scorer, the MLS path to the model, the model signature key, a `ModelSelector` for choosing the model name, desired candidate level feature store features to pass to the model, and desired candidate level feature store features to extract from the model. \n\nThe `build` method returns a `Scorer` object that can be used to score candidates based on the given model. The `Scorer` object takes in several type parameters, including the type of pipeline query, the type of candidates to score, the type of query level features consumed by the scorer, the type of candidate level features consumed by the scorer, and the type of candidate level features returned by the scorer. \n\nOverall, this class provides a way to build a Scorer object that can be used to score candidates based on a given model. This can be useful in a larger project where scoring candidates is a necessary step in the pipeline. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval scorerBuilder = new CortexManagedInferenceServiceDataRecordScorerBuilder(httpClient)\nval scorer = scorerBuilder.build(\n  scorerIdentifier = ScorerIdentifier(\"myScorer\"),\n  modelPath = \"/path/to/model\",\n  modelSignature = \"modelSignature\",\n  modelSelector = ModelSelector(query => \"modelName\"),\n  queryFeatures = FeaturesScope(Seq(MyQueryFeature)),\n  candidateFeatures = FeaturesScope(Seq(MyCandidateFeature)),\n  resultFeatures = Set(MyResultFeature)\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `CortexManagedInferenceServiceDataRecordScorerBuilder` that builds a configurable scorer to call into a desired DataRecord-backed Cortex Managed ML Model Service.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n- This code depends on several packages and classes from the `com.twitter` and `javax.inject` namespaces, as well as an `Http.Client` implementation provided by the `FinagleHttpClientModule`.\n\n3. What are the input and output types of the `build` method?\n- The `build` method takes in several type parameters representing the types of pipeline queries, candidates, query features, candidate features, and result features, as well as several other parameters such as the scorer identifier, model path, and model selector. It returns a `Scorer` object that takes in a pipeline query and a candidate and produces a score."

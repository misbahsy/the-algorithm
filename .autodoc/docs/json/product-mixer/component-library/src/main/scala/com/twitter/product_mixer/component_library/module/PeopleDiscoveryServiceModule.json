  "summary": "The `PeopleDiscoveryServiceModule` is a module that provides an implementation for an idempotent People Discovery Thrift client. It is designed to be used as a dependency in a larger project that requires communication with a People Discovery API. \n\nThe module is implemented as a Scala object and extends the `ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule` and `MtlsClient` traits. It provides reasonable defaults for per request and total timeouts, which can be further tuned for specific use cases. \n\nThe `configureMethodBuilder` method is overridden to configure the `MethodBuilder` with the default timeouts and idempotency settings. The `withTimeoutPerRequest` method sets the timeout for each request to 800 milliseconds, while the `withTimeoutTotal` method sets the total timeout for the request to 1200 milliseconds. The `idempotent` method sets the probability of a request being retried to 5 percent, which ensures that the request is idempotent. \n\nThe `sessionAcquisitionTimeout` method is also overridden to set the session acquisition timeout to 500 milliseconds. \n\nOverall, this module provides a convenient way to create an idempotent People Discovery Thrift client with reasonable default settings. It can be used in a larger project by simply importing the module and injecting it as a dependency. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass MyServiceModule extends TwitterModule {\n  override def configure(): Unit = {\n    bind[ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService.MethodPerEndpoint]\n      .toModuleSingle(ThriftMethodBuilderClientModule\n        .create[ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService.ServicePerEndpoint, ThriftPeopleDiscoveryService.MethodPerEndpoint]\n        .configured(PeopleDiscoveryServiceModule))\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is an implementation of a Thrift client for the People Discovery service. It sets reasonable defaults for per request and total timeouts, and also includes settings for idempotency and session acquisition timeout.\n\n2. What is the significance of the MtlsClient trait being included in this code?\n- The MtlsClient trait is included to enable mutual TLS authentication for the Thrift client. This ensures that both the client and server are authenticated and can communicate securely.\n\n3. Can the timeouts and idempotency settings be customized for specific use cases?\n- Yes, the comment in the code suggests that the timeouts and idempotency settings are meant to be starting points only, and can be further tuned for specific use cases by creating a local copy of the module."

  "summary": "The `DropOrthogonalCandidates` class is a selector component that limits the candidates to the first candidate source in the provided `orthogonalCandidatePipelines` sequence that has candidates in the candidate pool. For the subsequent candidate sources in the sequence, their candidates are removed from the candidate pool. \n\nThis component is used to filter out candidates that are not relevant to the current query. It takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the selected candidates. It returns a `SelectorResult` object containing the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result` sequences.\n\nThe `orthogonalCandidatePipelines` parameter is a sequence of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects that represent the candidate sources to be considered. The first matching orthogonal source is identified, and its candidates are retained in the candidate pool. The candidates from the subsequent orthogonal sources are removed from the candidate pool. If no matching orthogonal source is found, all candidates are retained in the candidate pool.\n\nHere are some examples of how this component works:\n\n```scala\nval orthogonalCandidatePipelines = Seq(\"D\", \"A\", \"C\").map(CandidatePipelineIdentifier(_))\nval remainingCandidates = Seq(\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details1\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details2\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details3\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details4\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details5\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"C\", \"details6\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"C\", \"details7\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details8\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details9\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details10\", \"D\")\n)\n\nval selector = DropOrthogonalCandidates(orthogonalCandidatePipelines)\nval result = selector.apply(PipelineQuery(), remainingCandidates, Seq())\n\n// result.remainingCandidates = Seq(\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details4\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details5\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details8\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details9\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"D\", \"details10\", \"D\")\n// )\n// result.result = Seq()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `orthogonalCandidatePipelines` sequence is `Seq(D, A, C)`, and the `remainingCandidates` sequence contains candidates from all four sources. The first matching orthogonal source is `A`, so its candidates are retained in the candidate pool. The candidates from the subsequent orthogonal sources `C` and `D` are removed from the candidate pool. The resulting `remainingCandidates` sequence contains only the candidates from sources `A` and `B`.\n\n```scala\nval orthogonalCandidatePipelines = Seq(\"D\", \"A\", \"C\").map(CandidatePipelineIdentifier(_))\nval remainingCandidates = Seq(\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details1\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details2\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details3\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details4\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details5\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"C\", \"details6\", \"D\"),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"C\", \"details7\", \"D\")\n)\n\nval selector = DropOrthogonalCandidates(orthogonalCandidatePipelines)\nval result = selector.apply(PipelineQuery(), remainingCandidates, Seq())\n\n// result.remainingCandidates = Seq(\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details1\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details2\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"A\", \"details3\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details4\", \"D\"),\n//   CandidateWithDetails(\"B\", \"details5\", \"D\")\n// )\n// result.result = Seq()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `orthogonalCandidatePipelines` sequence is `Seq(D, A, C)`, and the `remainingCandidates` sequence contains candidates from only three of the four sources. There are no candidates from the `D` source, so the first matching orthogonal source is `A`. Its candidates are retained in the candidate pool, and the candidates from the subsequent orthogonal sources `C` and `D` are removed from the candidate pool. The resulting `remainingCandidates` sequence contains only the candidates from sources `A` and `B`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a case class called `DropOrthogonalCandidates` that limits candidates to the first candidate source in the provided orthogonalCandidatePipelines sequence that has candidates in the candidate pool, and removes the candidates from the subsequent candidate sources in the sequence.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` representing the result. It returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the updated `remainingCandidates` and `result`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `pipelineScope` variable?\n- The `pipelineScope` variable is used to specify the scope of the selector, which in this case is a set of specific pipelines defined by the `orthogonalCandidatePipelines` sequence. It limits the candidates to those that belong to the specified pipelines."

  "summary": "This code defines a trait and two classes that are used for selecting which ML model to use in a pipeline query. The trait, called `ModelSelector`, takes a generic type parameter `Query` that must extend `PipelineQuery`. It defines a single abstract method `apply` that takes a `Query` object and returns an optional `String` representing the chosen model ID or name.\n\nThe first class, `ParamModelSelector`, is a concrete implementation of `ModelSelector` that selects a model based on a `Param` object. The `Param` object is a configuration parameter that is passed in as a constructor argument. The `apply` method of this class returns the value of the `Param` object from the `Query` object's `params` map.\n\nThe second class, `StaticModelSelector`, is another concrete implementation of `ModelSelector` that always selects the same model name. This class takes a `String` representing the model name as a constructor argument. The `apply` method of this class always returns the same model name.\n\nThese classes are likely used in a larger project that involves running ML models on pipeline queries. The `ModelSelector` trait allows for different strategies for selecting which model to use, depending on the needs of the pipeline. The `ParamModelSelector` class allows for dynamic selection of a model based on a configuration parameter, while the `StaticModelSelector` class allows for a fixed model to be used. \n\nHere is an example of how these classes might be used in a pipeline query:\n\n```\nval query = PipelineQuery(params = Map(\"model\" -> \"my_model\"))\nval modelSelector = ParamModelSelector(Param[String](\"model\"))\nval modelName = modelSelector(query).getOrElse(\"default_model\")\n// use the selected model name to run the ML model on the query\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines traits and classes for selecting which ML model to use when calling an underlying ML Model Service.\n\n2. What is the difference between ModelSelector and ParamModelSelector?\n   - ModelSelector is a trait that defines a method for selecting a model ID/name, while ParamModelSelector is a class that implements ModelSelector and selects a model based on a ConfigAPI Param object.\n\n3. Can StaticModelSelector be used with any type of PipelineQuery?\n   - No, StaticModelSelector can only be used with PipelineQuery and not any subtype of it, as it explicitly extends ModelSelector[PipelineQuery]."

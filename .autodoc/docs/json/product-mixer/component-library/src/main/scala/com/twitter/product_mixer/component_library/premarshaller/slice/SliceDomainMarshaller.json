  "summary": "The `SliceDomainMarshaller` class is a domain marshaller that generates slices for most candidates automatically. However, in rare cases where a candidate contains more than an ID, a different presentation can be provided by decorators that implement `BaseSliceItemPresentation`. \n\nThe `SliceDomainMarshaller` class extends the `DomainMarshaller` class and implements the `SliceBuilder` trait. It takes in a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` and returns a `Slice`. The `Slice` is generated by mapping over the `CandidateWithDetails` sequence and creating a new sequence of `BaseSliceItemPresentation` objects. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object has a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, the `sliceItem` is used to create a new `BaseSliceItemPresentation`. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object does not have a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, the `candidate` is matched against a series of cases to determine the type of `BaseSliceItemPresentation` to create. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object has a `presentation` that is not a `BaseSliceItemPresentation`, an `UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException` is thrown. If the `CandidateWithDetails` object is a `ModuleCandidateWithDetails`, an `UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException` is thrown.\n\nThis class is used in the larger project to generate slices for most candidates automatically. It can be used by passing in a `Query` and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` to generate a `Slice`. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval query: PipelineQuery = ???\nval candidateWithDetails: Seq[CandidateWithDetails] = ???\nval sliceDomainMarshaller = SliceDomainMarshaller()\nval slice: Slice = sliceDomainMarshaller(query, candidateWithDetails)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?\n- This code is a domain marshaller that generates slices for most candidates, but allows for a different presentation to be provided by decorators. It is used to create slices for various types of candidates in the project.\n\n2. What are some examples of candidates that would require a different presentation than the one generated automatically?\n- Candidates that contain more than an id, such as cursors that require a value/type, would require a different presentation than the one generated automatically.\n\n3. What exceptions might be thrown during the execution of this code, and why?\n- UndecoratedCandidateDomainMarshallerException, UnsupportedCandidateDomainMarshallerException, UnsupportedPresentationDomainMarshallerException, and UnsupportedModuleDomainMarshallerException might be thrown during the execution of this code. These exceptions are thrown when a candidate does not have a required decorator or when a presentation or module is not supported."

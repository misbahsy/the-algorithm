  "summary": "The `RelatedTopicsCandidateSource` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class generates a list of related topics results from the IDS (Interest Discovery Service) `getRelatedTopics` endpoint. It returns related topics given a topic, whereas another class called `RecommendedTopicsCandidateSource` returns recommended topics given a user. \n\nThis class is a singleton and is injected with an instance of `t.InterestsDiscoveryService.MethodPerEndpoint`. It extends the `CandidateSource` trait, which takes two type parameters: `t.RelatedTopicsRequest` and `t.RelatedTopic`. The `CandidateSourceIdentifier` is a case class that identifies the candidate source by name. In this case, the name is \"RelatedTopics\". \n\nThe `apply` method takes a `t.RelatedTopicsRequest` as input and returns a `Stitch[Seq[t.RelatedTopic]]`. The `Stitch` library is used to make asynchronous calls to the IDS `getRelatedTopics` endpoint. The `callFuture` method is used to call the endpoint and returns a `Future[t.RelatedTopicsResponse]`. The `map` method is then used to extract the `topics` field from the response and return it as a sequence of `t.RelatedTopic` objects. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to generate related topics given a topic. For example, if the user is interested in \"machine learning\", this class can be used to generate a list of related topics such as \"artificial intelligence\", \"data science\", and \"deep learning\". This information can then be used to recommend content or products to the user based on their interests. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval relatedTopicsSource = new RelatedTopicsCandidateSource(interestDiscoveryService)\nval request = t.RelatedTopicsRequest(topic = \"machine learning\")\nval relatedTopics: Seq[t.RelatedTopic] = relatedTopicsSource(request).get()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    - This code generates a list of related topics results from IDS getRelatedTopics (thrift) endpoint and returns related topics given a topic.\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n    - This code has dependencies on Google Guice, Twitter Inject, Twitter Interests Discovery, Twitter Product Mixer, and Twitter Stitch.\n3. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?\n    - The input of the `apply` method is a `t.RelatedTopicsRequest` object, and the output is a `Stitch[Seq[t.RelatedTopic]]` object."

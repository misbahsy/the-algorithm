  "summary": "The `DropDuplicateCandidates` class is a selector component that is used to remove duplicate candidates from a sequence of candidates. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to keep only the first instance of a candidate in the `remainingCandidates` sequence as determined by comparing the contained candidate ID and class type. Subsequent matching instances will be dropped. This is done by calling the `dropDuplicates` method from the `DropSelector` class. The `duplicationKey` parameter is used to generate the key used to identify duplicate candidates. By default, it uses the ID and class name. The `mergeStrategy` parameter is used to determine how to merge two candidates with the same key. By default, it picks the first one.\n\nThis class ignores `CursorCandidate` and `ModuleCandidateWithDetails` candidates. It takes in a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects as input. It returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the deduplicated candidates and the result.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this class:\n\n```scala\nval candidates = Seq(\n  sourceA_Id1,\n  sourceA_Id1,\n  sourceA_Id2,\n  sourceB_id1,\n  sourceB_id2,\n  sourceB_id3,\n  sourceC_id4\n)\n\nval selector = DropDuplicateCandidates()\nval result = selector.apply(query, candidates, Seq())\n\nprintln(result.remainingCandidates)\n// Output: Seq(sourceA_Id1, sourceA_Id2, sourceB_id3, sourceC_id4)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `candidates` sequence contains duplicate candidates. The `selector` object is created using the default parameters. The `apply` method is called with the `query`, `candidates`, and an empty sequence as input. The `result` object contains the deduplicated candidates. The output is `Seq(sourceA_Id1, sourceA_Id2, sourceB_id3, sourceC_id4)`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a case class `DropDuplicateCandidates` that removes duplicate candidates from a sequence of candidates based on a key generated by comparing the candidate ID and class type.\n\n2. What other components or libraries does this code depend on?\n    \n    This code depends on several other components and libraries, including `DropSelector`, `AllPipelines`, `CandidateScope`, `Selector`, `SelectorResult`, `CandidateWithDetails`, and `PipelineQuery`.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n    \n    The expected input of this code is a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects. The expected output is a `SelectorResult` object containing the deduplicated candidates and the original result."

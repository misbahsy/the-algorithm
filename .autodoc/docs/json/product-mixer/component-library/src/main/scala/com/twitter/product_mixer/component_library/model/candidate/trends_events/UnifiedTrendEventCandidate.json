  "summary": "This code defines a set of classes and features for representing and manipulating Event and Trend content in the context of the larger project, The Algorithm from Twitter. \n\nThe `UnifiedTrendEventCandidate` trait is a sealed trait that represents a piece of Event or Trend content. It has two subtypes: `UnifiedEventCandidate` and `UnifiedTrendCandidate`. The former has a `Long` eventId, while the latter has a `String` trendName. These classes are used to represent the unique identifier for each Event or Trend content.\n\nThe `Feature` trait is used to represent a specific feature of an Event or Trend content. For example, `EventTitleFeature` is a feature that represents the text description of an Event, while `TrendNormalizedTrendName` represents the normalized name of a Trend. Each feature is associated with a specific `UnifiedTrendEventCandidate` subtype.\n\nThe purpose of these classes and features is to provide a standardized way of representing and manipulating Event and Trend content across the larger project. For example, the `EventTitleFeature` can be used to extract the text description of an Event, which can then be used to display the Event in a client application. Similarly, the `TrendNormalizedTrendName` can be used to normalize the name of a Trend, which can then be used to group similar Trends together.\n\nOverall, this code provides a foundation for working with Event and Trend content in the larger project, and allows for easy manipulation and extraction of specific features of that content.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the UnifiedTrendEventCandidate trait and its subclasses?\n- The UnifiedTrendEventCandidate trait and its subclasses represent either an Event or Trend content, with Event represented by a Long eventId and Trend represented by a String trendName.\n\n2. What are some examples of features that can be extracted from an Event candidate?\n- Examples of features that can be extracted from an Event candidate include the text description of the Event (EventTitleFeature), the display type of the Event (EventDisplayType), the URL of the Event landing page (EventUrl), the editorial image of the Event (EventImage), and the localized time string used to render the Event cell (EventTimeString).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the PromotedTrendDisclosureTypeFeature feature?\n- The PromotedTrendDisclosureTypeFeature feature is used to represent the type of disclosure for a promoted Trend candidate, such as whether it is sponsored or organic."

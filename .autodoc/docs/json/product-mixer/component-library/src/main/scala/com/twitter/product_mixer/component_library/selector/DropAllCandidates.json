  "summary": "The code defines a Scala case class called `DropAllCandidates` that extends the `Selector` trait. The purpose of this class is to drop all candidates on the `remainingCandidates` side that are in the `pipelineScope`. The `pipelineScope` is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class, which is defined in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.common` package. The `CandidateScope` class represents the scope of a pipeline, which is a set of candidates that are eligible for selection by the pipeline.\n\nThe `DropAllCandidates` class takes an optional `pipelineScope` parameter in its constructor, which defaults to `AllPipelines`. The `AllPipelines` object is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class that represents all pipelines. This means that if no `pipelineScope` is specified, all candidates will be dropped.\n\nThe `apply` method of the `DropAllCandidates` class takes three parameters: a `PipelineQuery` object, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the remaining candidates, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` objects representing the result of the selection process so far. The method first partitions the `remainingCandidates` into two sequences: `inScope` and `outOfScope`. The `inScope` sequence contains all candidates that are in the `pipelineScope`, while the `outOfScope` sequence contains all candidates that are not in the `pipelineScope`. The method then returns a `SelectorResult` object that contains the `outOfScope` sequence as the new `remainingCandidates` and the original `result` sequence.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project as a simple filter to drop candidates based only on the `CandidateScope`. It can also be used as a placeholder when templating out a new pipeline. For example, if a new pipeline is being created and no candidates have been selected yet, the `DropAllCandidates` class can be used to drop all candidates until the pipeline is fully defined. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval pipelineScope = CandidateScope(Seq(\"pipeline1\", \"pipeline2\"))\nval remainingCandidates = Seq(\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"candidate1\", Map(\"pipeline\" -> \"pipeline1\")),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"candidate2\", Map(\"pipeline\" -> \"pipeline2\")),\n  CandidateWithDetails(\"candidate3\", Map(\"pipeline\" -> \"pipeline3\"))\n)\nval result = Seq.empty[CandidateWithDetails]\n\nval dropAllCandidates = DropAllCandidates(pipelineScope)\nval selectorResult = dropAllCandidates.apply(PipelineQuery(), remainingCandidates, result)\n\nprintln(selectorResult.remainingCandidates)\n// Output: Seq(CandidateWithDetails(\"candidate3\", Map(\"pipeline\" -> \"pipeline3\")))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DropAllCandidates` class?\n   - The `DropAllCandidates` class drops all candidates on the `remainingCandidates` side which are in the `pipelineScope`.\n2. What is the input and output of the `apply` method?\n   - The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` for `remainingCandidates`, and a sequence of `CandidateWithDetails` for `result`. It returns a `SelectorResult` object.\n3. What is the `pipelineScope` parameter and how is it used?\n   - The `pipelineScope` parameter is an instance of the `CandidateScope` class and is used to partition the `remainingCandidates` into those that are in the scope and those that are out of scope. The candidates that are out of scope are returned as part of the `SelectorResult`."

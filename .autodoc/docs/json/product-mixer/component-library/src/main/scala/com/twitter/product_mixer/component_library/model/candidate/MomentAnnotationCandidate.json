  "summary": "The code defines a class called `MomentAnnotationCandidate` which extends the `UniversalNoun` class. This class is used to represent a candidate for a moment annotation. The class has three fields: `id`, `text`, and `header`. The `id` field is of type `Long` and is used to uniquely identify the candidate. The `text` and `header` fields are both of type `Option[String]` and represent the text and header of the candidate respectively. The class also has an `equals` method which is used to compare two `MomentAnnotationCandidate` objects for equality. The `equals` method checks if the two objects are the same object, have the same hash code, and have the same `id`, `text`, and `header` fields. The class also has a `hashCode` method which is used to generate a hash code for the object. The hash code is generated using the `id`, `text`, and `header` fields. The class is marked as `final` to prevent inheritance and ensure that the `equals` method works correctly. \n\nThe `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class is used in the larger project to represent a candidate for a moment annotation. The class is designed to be immutable and has a high-performance implementation of the `equals` method. The `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class is also designed to be used with the `UniversalNoun` class, which provides a common interface for working with different types of nouns. \n\nThe `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class has a companion object which provides a factory method for creating instances of the class. The factory method takes three arguments: `id`, `text`, and `header`, and returns a new instance of the `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval candidate = MomentAnnotationCandidate(1, Some(\"text\"), Some(\"header\"))\nval candidate2 = MomentAnnotationCandidate(2, Some(\"text\"), Some(\"header\"))\nval candidate3 = MomentAnnotationCandidate(1, Some(\"text\"), Some(\"header\"))\n\nprintln(candidate == candidate2) // false\nprintln(candidate == candidate3) // true\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class?\n- The `MomentAnnotationCandidate` class is a model for a candidate with a specific set of fields, and it should always be preferred over other variants.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in this class?\n- The `equals` method is used to check if two `MomentAnnotationCandidate` objects are equal, while the `hashCode` method is used to cache the hash code of an object for performance reasons.\n\n3. What are the constraints for caching the hash code of a `MomentAnnotationCandidate` object?\n- The fields used to construct the hash code must be immutable, including the object reference and the object instance itself. Additionally, the `##` method should be used for boxed numeric types and null to ensure consistency with object equality."

  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `ScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect` which extends the `PipelineResultSideEffect` trait. This trait is used to log data in a format that can be consumed by Scribe. The `ScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect` trait has a single abstract method called `buildLogEvents` which takes in several parameters including the query, selected candidates, remaining candidates, dropped candidates, and response. The method returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `Thrift` objects. \n\nThe `ScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect` trait also has a `logPipelinePublisher` field which is an `EventPublisher` of `Thrift` objects. The `apply` method is overridden to build the log events using the `buildLogEvents` method and then publish them using the `logPipelinePublisher`. \n\nThis trait can be used in the larger project to log data in a format that can be consumed by Scribe. The `buildLogEvents` method can be implemented to build the log events in a custom way depending on the needs of the project. The `logPipelinePublisher` field can be set to an appropriate `EventPublisher` instance to publish the log events. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass CustomScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect extends ScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect[CustomThrift, CustomQuery, CustomResponseType] {\n  override def buildLogEvents(\n    query: CustomQuery,\n    selectedCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails],\n    remainingCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails],\n    droppedCandidates: Seq[CandidateWithDetails],\n    response: CustomResponseType\n  ): Stitch[Seq[CustomThrift]] = {\n    // custom implementation to build log events\n  }\n\n  override val logPipelinePublisher: EventPublisher[CustomThrift] = new CustomEventPublisher()\n}\n\nval customScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect = new CustomScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect()\n\nval pipeline = Pipeline[CustomQuery, CustomResponseType]()\n  .addSideEffect(customScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect)\n  .addSelector(customSelector)\n  .addMarshaller(customMarshaller)\n  .addUnMarshaller(customUnMarshaller)\n``` \n\nIn this example, a custom implementation of the `ScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect` trait is created and used in a pipeline. The `buildLogEvents` method is implemented to build the log events in a custom way and the `logPipelinePublisher` field is set to a custom `EventPublisher` instance. The `customScribeLogEventAsyncSideEffect` instance is added as a side effect to the pipeline along with other components such as a selector, marshaller, and unmarshaller.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a trait for a PipelineResultSideEffect that logs Thrift data that may not already be available to Scribe.\n\n2. What other components or libraries does this code depend on?\n- This code depends on several other components and libraries, including com.twitter.logpipeline.client.common.EventPublisher, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.side_effect.PipelineResultSideEffect, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.presentation.CandidateWithDetails, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.HasMarshalling, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineQuery, com.twitter.scrooge.ThriftStruct, and com.twitter.stitch.Stitch.\n\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n- The expected output of this code is a Stitch that collects and publishes log events in Thrift format."

  "summary": "The code defines a class called `WhoToFollowArmDependentCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder` that builds a configuration object for a candidate pipeline used in the \"Who to Follow\" module of Twitter. The configuration object is an instance of `WhoToFollowArmDependentCandidatePipelineConfig`, which is returned by the `build` method of the builder class. \n\nThe `build` method takes several parameters that customize the configuration object. These include a builder for the module display type, an identifier for the pipeline, decider and client parameters, alerts, gates, filters, and features. The `accountRecommendationsMixerCandidateSource` parameter is injected into the builder class and is used to populate the configuration object with a candidate source. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a flexible way to configure a candidate pipeline for the \"Who to Follow\" module. The pipeline is responsible for generating a list of recommended users for a given query, which is then displayed to the user in the module. The configuration object specifies how the pipeline should behave, including which candidate source to use, which filters to apply, and which features to use. \n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that implements the \"Who to Follow\" module in Twitter. Other components of the project may use the configuration object to create and run the candidate pipeline, and to display the results to the user. For example, the module display type builder may be used to customize the appearance of the module based on the user's preferences or device type. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval builder = new WhoToFollowArmDependentCandidatePipelineConfigBuilder(candidateSource)\nval config = builder.build(\n  moduleDisplayTypeBuilder = new MyModuleDisplayTypeBuilder(),\n  identifier = MyPipelineIdentifier,\n  enabledDeciderParam = Some(new MyDeciderParam()),\n  supportedClientParam = Some(new MyClientParam()),\n  alerts = Seq(new MyAlert()),\n  gates = Seq(new MyGate()),\n  filters = Seq(new MyFilter()),\n  feedbackActionInfoBuilder = Some(new MyFeedbackActionInfoBuilder()),\n  displayLocationParam = new MyDisplayLocationParam(),\n  excludedUserIdsFeature = Some(new MyExcludedUserIdsFeature()),\n  profileUserIdFeature = Some(new MyProfileUserIdFeature())\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a Scala class that builds a configuration for a candidate pipeline for the Who To Follow module on Twitter. It takes in various parameters and returns a `WhoToFollowArmDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` object.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including `AccountRecommendationsMixerCandidateSource`, `UserCandidate`, `BaseFeedbackActionInfoBuilder`, `BaseModuleDisplayTypeBuilder`, and `PipelineQuery`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `build` method and what parameters does it take?\n- The `build` method is used to create a `WhoToFollowArmDependentCandidatePipelineConfig` object with various parameters. It takes in a `BaseModuleDisplayTypeBuilder`, a `CandidatePipelineIdentifier`, optional `DeciderParam` and `FSParam` objects, sequences of `Alert`, `BaseGate`, and `Filter` objects, an optional `BaseFeedbackActionInfoBuilder`, a `Param` object, and optional `Feature` objects."

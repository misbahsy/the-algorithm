  "summary": "The `DynamicPositionSelector` object in the `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.selector` package provides a method called `mergeByIndexIntoResult` that allows for the insertion of elements into a sequence at specific indices. The method takes in three parameters: `candidatesToInsertByIndex`, `result`, and `indexType`. \n\nThe `candidatesToInsertByIndex` parameter is a sequence of tuples where the first element is an integer representing the index at which the second element should be inserted into the `result` sequence. The `result` parameter is the sequence into which the elements will be inserted. The `indexType` parameter is an enumeration that specifies whether the indices in `candidatesToInsertByIndex` are relative to the `result` sequence or absolute. \n\nThe method returns a new sequence with the inserted elements. If multiple candidates exist with the same index, they are inserted in the order which they appear and only count as a single element with regards to the absolute index values. \n\nThe method works by first sorting the `candidatesToInsertByIndex` sequence by the desired absolute index in ascending order. It then iterates over both the `result` and `candidatesToInsertByIndex` sequences, inserting the elements from `candidatesToInsertByIndex` into the `result` sequence at the specified indices. If multiple candidates exist with the same index, they are inserted in the order which they appear and only count as a single element with regards to the absolute index values. \n\nThe `mergeByIndexIntoResult` method is useful for scenarios where elements need to be inserted into a sequence at specific indices. For example, it could be used in a recommendation system to insert recommended items into a user's shopping cart at specific positions. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `mergeByIndexIntoResult` method:\n\n```\nval result = Seq(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")\nval candidatesToInsertByIndex = Seq((1, \"x\"), (3, \"y\"))\nval indexType = DynamicPositionSelector.RelativeIndices\n\nval updatedResult = DynamicPositionSelector.mergeByIndexIntoResult(candidatesToInsertByIndex, result, indexType)\n// updatedResult: Seq[String] = List(a, x, b, c, y, d)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DynamicPositionSelector` object?\n- The `DynamicPositionSelector` object contains a method called `mergeByIndexIntoResult` that inserts candidates into a result sequence based on their index.\n\n2. What is the difference between `RelativeIndices` and `AbsoluteIndices`?\n- `RelativeIndices` refers to the index relative to the `result` sequence, while `AbsoluteIndices` refers to the absolute index of the candidate.\n\n3. How are duplicate insertions handled?\n- If multiple candidates exist with the same index, they are inserted in the order which they appear and only count as a single element with regards to the absolute index values."

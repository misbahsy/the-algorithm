  "summary": "The code defines a module for building a Finatra HTTP client with egress proxy support for a host. The module is built using the TwitterModule class and provides a method that returns an instance of the HttpClient class. The HttpClient class is used to make HTTP requests and provides built-in JSON response parsing and other convenience methods.\n\nThe module takes in several parameters, including the Twitter egress proxy host and port, the remote proxy host and port, and various timeout values. These parameters are used to build a Finagle HTTP client with proxy support using the buildFinagleHttpClientWithProxy and buildFinagleHttpServiceWithProxy methods from the FinagleHttpClientWithProxyBuilder class. The resulting Finagle HTTP client is then used to create an instance of the HttpClient class.\n\nThe module is designed to be used in larger projects that require making HTTP requests with egress proxy support. The built-in JSON response parsing and other convenience methods provided by the HttpClient class make it easier to work with HTTP responses. The module can be customized by overriding the flags or creating a local copy of the module to further tune the settings.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval client = injector.instance[HttpClient](FinatraHttpClientWithProxyModule.FinatraHttpClientWithProxy)\nval response = client.get(\"https://example.com\")\nprintln(response.contentString)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides a module for building a Finatra HTTP client with Egress Proxy support for a host. It solves the problem of needing a convenient HTTP client with built-in JSON response parsing and other features.\n\n2. What are the configurable parameters for building the Finatra HTTP client?\n- The configurable parameters include the Twitter egress proxy host and port, remote proxy host and port, HTTP client request timeout, transport connect timeout, session acquisition timeout, and whether the service is local for testing.\n\n3. What are the dependencies required for this code to work?\n- The dependencies required for this code to work include com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.finatra.httpclient.HttpClient, com.twitter.inject.TwitterModule, com.twitter.inject.annotations.Flag, com.twitter.product_mixer.core.module.product_mixer_flags.ProductMixerFlagModule.ServiceLocal, com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.http_client.FinagleHttpClientWithProxyBuilder, com.twitter.product_mixer.shared_library.http_client.HttpHostPort, com.twitter.util.Duration, and com.twitter.util.jackson.ScalaObjectMapper."

  "summary": "The `RecencyCacheRequestNormalizer` class is a cache request normalizer that is used in the Earlybird search system at Twitter. The purpose of this class is to normalize search requests before they are cached. This is done to ensure that identical search requests are treated as the same and can be served from the cache, rather than being executed again. \n\nThe class extends the `CacheRequestNormalizer` class, which is a generic class that takes two type parameters: `RequestContext` and `Request`. In this case, `EarlybirdRequestContext` and `EarlybirdRequest` are used as the type parameters. The `normalizeRequest` method is overridden to provide the normalization logic. \n\nThe `normalizeRequest` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns an `Optional` object that contains an `EarlybirdRequest` object. The `Optional` class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. In this case, if the normalization is successful, an `EarlybirdRequest` object is returned, otherwise, an empty `Optional` object is returned. \n\nThe normalization logic is implemented using the `CacheUtil.normalizeRequestForCache` method, which is a static method from the `CacheUtil` class. This method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object as input and returns a normalized `EarlybirdRequest` object. The normalization process involves removing any non-deterministic elements from the request, such as timestamps or random values, so that identical requests are treated as the same. \n\nOverall, the `RecencyCacheRequestNormalizer` class is an important component of the Earlybird search system at Twitter, as it helps to improve search performance by caching identical search requests. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);\nRecencyCacheRequestNormalizer normalizer = new RecencyCacheRequestNormalizer();\nOptional<EarlybirdRequest> normalizedRequest = normalizer.normalizeRequest(requestContext);\nif (normalizedRequest.isPresent()) {\n  // Use the normalized request for caching\n} else {\n  // The request could not be normalized, do not cache\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code is a cache request normalizer for the Earlybird search algorithm from Twitter.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   This code has dependencies on the Google Guava library and the Earlybird search algorithm from Twitter.\n\n3. How does this code fit into the overall Earlybird search algorithm?\n   This code is a small component of the Earlybird search algorithm that helps normalize cache requests."

  "summary": "The `ProtectedOperatorQueryRewriter` class is responsible for rewriting a query with a positive 'protected' operator into an equivalent query without the positive 'protected' operator. This class is part of the Earlybird search system, which is used by Twitter to index and search tweets. \n\nThe `rewrite` method takes in a parsed query, a list of followed user IDs, and a user table. It first checks that the list of followed user IDs is not empty and that the root node of the parsed query is a conjunction. It then finds the positive 'protected' operator in the root node and extracts it. \n\nIf the positive 'protected' operator is a '[filter protected]' operator, the method creates a new query with a `multi_term_disjunction` operator that matches tweets from the protected users only. If there are no protected users, the method returns an empty disjunction. \n\nIf the positive 'protected' operator is an '[include protected]' operator or a negated '[exclude protected]' operator, the method creates two new queries: one that matches tweets from the protected users only, and one that matches tweets from the public users only. It then returns a disjunction of these two queries. If there are no protected users, the method returns a query that matches tweets from the public users only. \n\nThe `createFromUserIdMultiTermDisjunctionQuery` method creates a new query with a `multi_term_disjunction` operator that matches tweets from the specified user IDs only. \n\nThe `getProtectedUserIds` method takes in a list of followed user IDs and a user table, and returns a list of user IDs that are marked as protected in the user table. \n\nThe `findPositiveProtectedOperatorIndex` method takes in a list of queries and returns the index of the positive 'protected' operator in the list, or -1 if it is not found. \n\nThe `isNegateExclude` method takes in a search operator and returns true if it is a negated '[exclude protected]' operator. \n\nThe `isPositive` method takes in a search operator and returns true if it is a positive '[include protected]' or '[filter protected]' operator. \n\nOverall, the `ProtectedOperatorQueryRewriter` class is an important part of the Earlybird search system that allows users to search for tweets from protected users. It is used to rewrite queries with positive 'protected' operators into equivalent queries that can be executed by the search system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a query rewriter for a Twitter search algorithm that removes positive 'protected' operators from a query and rewrites it into an equivalent query without the operator.\n\n2. What are the preconditions for using this code?\n- The 'followedUserIds' list should not be empty when a positive 'protected' operator exists in the query. \n- The root node of the query should be a Conjunction and not negated. \n- There should be only one positive 'protected' operator in the root node and only one 'protected' operator in the whole query.\n\n3. What is the output of this code?\n- The output of this code is a rewritten query without the positive 'protected' operator. If the original query had an '[include protected]' operator, it is rewritten into a Disjunction of a query with protected Tweets only and a query with public Tweets only. If the original query had a '[filter protected]' operator, it is rewritten with a multi_term_disjunction from_user_id operator."

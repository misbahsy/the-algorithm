  "summary": "The `ClientIdWhitelistModule` class is a module that provides a `ClientIdWhitelist` object. This object is used to periodically load the client whitelist for the Feature Update Service from ConfigBus. \n\nThe `ClientIdWhitelist` object is created by calling the `initWhitelist` method, which takes a `String` parameter representing the path to the client id white list. This method returns a `ClientIdWhitelist` object that is then provided by the `provideClientWhitelist` method.\n\nThis module also defines two flags that can be used to configure the behavior of the `ClientIdWhitelist` object. The `client.whitelist.path` flag is used to specify the path to the client id white list, and the `client.whitelist.enable` flag is used to enable or disable the client whitelist for production.\n\nThis module is likely used in the larger project to provide a `ClientIdWhitelist` object to other parts of the system that need to access the client whitelist. For example, the `ClientIdWhitelist` object may be used by a service that needs to determine whether a particular client is authorized to access the Feature Update Service.\n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used:\n\n```\npublic class MyService {\n  private final ClientIdWhitelist clientIdWhitelist;\n\n  @Inject\n  public MyService(ClientIdWhitelist clientIdWhitelist) {\n    this.clientIdWhitelist = clientIdWhitelist;\n  }\n\n  public void doSomething() {\n    // Check if client is authorized\n    if (clientIdWhitelist.isAuthorized(clientId)) {\n      // Do something\n    } else {\n      // Throw an exception or return an error\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this module?\n   This module provides a ClientIdWhitelist that periodically loads the Feature Update Service client whitelist from ConfigBus.\n\n2. What flags are available for this module?\n   There are two flags available for this module: \"client.whitelist.path\" and \"client.whitelist.enable\". The first flag specifies the path to the client id white list, while the second flag enables the client whitelist for production.\n\n3. What does the provideClientWhitelist method do?\n   The provideClientWhitelist method provides a singleton instance of the ClientIdWhitelist class, initialized with the path to the client id white list specified by the \"client.whitelist.path\" flag."

  "summary": "The `EarlybirdStatus` class provides a high-level status of an Earlybird server. It contains methods to set and get the status of the server, record events, and get the build SHA of the server. \n\nThe class has several static variables that are used to store the server status, start time, and event information. The `setStatus` method sets the status of the server, which can be either `STARTING` or `CURRENT`. The `getStatusMessage` method returns the status message along with the state of the warmup and production thrift ports. The `recordEarlybirdEvent` method records an event with a given name and timestamp. The `getEarlybirdEvents` method returns a list of all events that have occurred since the server started.\n\nThe class also has methods to record the beginning and end of an event. The `beginEvent` method records the start time of an event and the `endEvent` method records the end time of an event and calculates the duration of the event. These methods use the `SearchIndexingMetricSet.StartupMetric` class to keep track of the time for each event.\n\nThe `getBuildSha` method returns the build SHA of the server. It uses the `BuildInfo` class to get the build information and returns the SHA if it exists, otherwise it returns \"UNKNOWN\".\n\nOverall, the `EarlybirdStatus` class provides a way to monitor the status of an Earlybird server and record events that occur during its operation. It can be used to diagnose issues and track the performance of the server. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// Set the start time of the server\nEarlybirdStatus.setStartTime(System.currentTimeMillis());\n\n// Record an event\nEarlybirdStatus.recordEarlybirdEvent(\"Processing started\");\n\n// Set the status of the server\nEarlybirdStatus.setStatus(EarlybirdStatusCode.STARTING);\n\n// Get the status message\nString statusMessage = EarlybirdStatus.getStatusMessage();\n\n// Get the build SHA of the server\nString buildSha = EarlybirdStatus.getBuildSha();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines the status of an Earlybird server and provides methods to set and get the status, record events, and retrieve the list of events that happened since the server started.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on several external libraries, including Google Guava, SLF4J, and Twitter Common.\n\n3. What is the significance of the BUILD_SHA variable?\n- The BUILD_SHA variable stores the SHA of the Git revision used to build the Earlybird server. It is retrieved from the BuildInfo object, which provides information about the build environment."

  "summary": "The `EarlybirdProductionFinagleServerManager` class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of two Finagle servers: a warm-up server and a production server. The warm-up server is used to warm up the production server by pre-loading data and performing other tasks before the production server is started. The production server is the main server that handles incoming requests.\n\nThe class implements the `EarlybirdFinagleServerManager` interface, which defines methods for starting and stopping the warm-up and production servers. The class has two `AtomicReference` fields that hold references to the warm-up and production servers. The `isWarmUpServerRunning()` and `isProductionServerRunning()` methods check if the warm-up and production servers are running, respectively.\n\nThe `startWarmUpFinagleServer()` and `startProductionFinagleServer()` methods start the warm-up and production servers, respectively. Both methods take a `serviceIface`, `serviceName`, and `port` as arguments. The `serviceIface` is an interface that defines the methods that the server",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Java implementation of a Finagle server for the Earlybird service, which is a Twitter search service.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries, including Apache Thrift, Finagle, and ZipkinTracer.\n\n3. What is the role of the `EarlybirdProductionFinagleServerManager` class?\n- The `EarlybirdProductionFinagleServerManager` class is responsible for managing the warm-up and production Finagle servers for the Earlybird service, including starting and stopping the servers and checking their status."

  "summary": "The `EarlybirdRequestContext` class is a wrapper around an `EarlybirdRequest` object, which contains additional data that should be passed to services. This class is immutable and thread-safe, and it is used to create new contexts with the provided request and additional data.\n\nThe class has several static methods that create new contexts with different parameters. The `newContext` method creates a new context with the provided `EarlybirdRequest`, `SearchDecider`, `Viewer`, and `Clock`. It captures the created time as early as possible and returns a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` object.\n\nThe `newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64` method creates a new context with the intersection of the `userID` and the `flock` response, which is set in the `followedUserIds` field. This is used for the protected cluster.\n\nThe `copyRequestContext` method makes an exact copy of the provided request context by cloning the underlying `EarlybirdRequest`.\n\nThe `newContext` method creates a new context with the provided request, context, and resets both the feature schemas cached in the client and the feature schemas cached in the local cache.\n\nThe `deepCopy` method creates a new `EarlybirdRequestContext` object with a deep copy of the `request` object, `parsedQuery`, `useOverrideTierConfig`, `createdTimeMillis`, and `twitterContextViewer`.\n\nThe class has several private fields, including `request`, `earlybirdRequestType`, `parsedQuery`, `useOverrideTierConfig`, `createdTimeMillis`, `twitterContextViewer`, and `featureSchemasAvailableInClient`. These fields are used to store the data that is passed to services.\n\nOverall, the `EarlybirdRequestContext` class is an important part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project, as it provides a way to pass additional data to services and create new contexts with different parameters.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the EarlybirdRequestContext class?\n- The EarlybirdRequestContext class is a wrapper for a request and additional per-request data that should be passed to services.\n\n2. What is the significance of the useOverrideTierConfig variable?\n- The useOverrideTierConfig variable is used to determine whether to use override tier configurations or not.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64 method?\n- The newContextWithRestrictFromUserIdFilter64 method is used to create a new EarlybirdRequestContext with an intersection of the userID and the flock response, which is set in the followedUserIds field. This is used for protected cluster."

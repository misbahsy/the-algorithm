  "summary": "The code defines a Java class called `RecencyServicePostProcessor` that extends the `ServicePostProcessor` class. This class is responsible for caching search results for the Earlybird search service from Twitter. \n\nThe `RecencyServicePostProcessor` class takes two parameters in its constructor: a `Cache` object and an integer `maxCacheResults`. The `Cache` object is used to store the search results, while `maxCacheResults` specifies the maximum number of search results that can be stored in the cache.\n\nThe `processServiceResponse` method is overridden from the `ServicePostProcessor` class and is called when a search request is made to the Earlybird search service. This method takes two parameters: a `requestContext` object and a `serviceResponse` object. The `requestContext` object contains information about the search request, while the `serviceResponse` object contains the search results.\n\nThe `CacheUtil.cacheResults` method is called with the `cache`, `requestContext.getRequest()`, `serviceResponse`, and `maxCacheResults` parameters. This method caches the search results in the `Cache` object, using the search request as the key and the search results as the value. If the number of cached search results exceeds `maxCacheResults`, the oldest results are removed from the cache.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to cache search results for the Earlybird search service, which can improve performance by reducing the number of requests made to the service. The `RecencyServicePostProcessor` class can be used in conjunction with other classes and methods to implement caching for the Earlybird search service in a larger project. For example, a class that handles search requests could use the `RecencyServicePostProcessor` class to cache search results and return cached results when possible, rather than making a new request to the Earlybird search service.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code is a service post-processor for caching search results in the Earlybird application from Twitter.\n\n2. What is the input and output of the `processServiceResponse` method?\n   - The input of the `processServiceResponse` method is an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object and an `EarlybirdResponse` object. The output is void.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `maxCacheResults` parameter?\n   - The `maxCacheResults` parameter specifies the maximum number of search results that can be cached by the `CacheUtil` class."

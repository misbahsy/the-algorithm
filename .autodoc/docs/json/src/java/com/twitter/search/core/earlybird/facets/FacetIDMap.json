  "summary": "The `FacetIDMap` class is a utility class that provides a mapping between facet names and facet IDs. A facet is a search criterion that is used to filter search results. The class provides methods to retrieve the facet field based on the facet name or ID. It also provides methods to retrieve all the facet fields and the number of facet fields.\n\nThe class has a private constructor and a static factory method `build` that takes a `Schema` object and returns a new instance of `FacetIDMap`. The `Schema` object contains information about the fields in the search index, including the facet fields. The `build` method creates a new `FacetIDMap` instance by iterating over the fields in the schema and adding the facet fields to the `facetIDToFieldMap` array. The `facetNameToIDMap` is then populated with the facet names and their corresponding IDs.\n\nThe `FacetIDMap` class also has a nested class `FacetField` that represents a facet field. It contains the facet ID, the field information, the facet name, and a description of the facet field.\n\nThe `FacetIDMap` class implements the `Flushable` interface, which allows it to be serialized and deserialized. The `FlushHandler` class is used to serialize and deserialize the `FacetIDMap` object. The `doFlush` method writes the facet ID map to a `DataSerializer` object, and the `doLoad` method reads the facet ID map from a `DataDeserializer` object.\n\nThe `FacetIDMap` class is used in the larger project to provide a mapping between facet names and facet IDs. This mapping is used by other classes in the project to filter search results based on the facet criteria. For example, the `FacetFilter` class uses the `FacetIDMap` to create a filter query based on the selected facet criteria. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nSchema schema = ... // create a schema object\nFacetIDMap facetIDMap = FacetIDMap.build(schema);\n\nFacetField facetField = facetIDMap.getFacetFieldByFacetName(\"category\");\nint facetId = facetField.getFacetId();\n\nCollection<FacetField> facetFields = facetIDMap.getFacetFields();\nint numFacetFields = facetIDMap.getNumberOfFacetFields();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the FacetIDMap class?\n- The FacetIDMap class is used to map facet names and IDs to field information for a given schema.\n\n2. How is a new FacetIDMap built?\n- A new FacetIDMap is built by iterating through the field infos in a given schema and adding any that are facet fields to the facetIDToFieldMap.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the FlushHandler class?\n- The FlushHandler class is used to serialize and deserialize FacetIDMap objects for storage and retrieval."

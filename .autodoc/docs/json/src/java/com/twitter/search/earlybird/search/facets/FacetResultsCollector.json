  "summary": "The `FacetResultsCollector` class is responsible for collecting and aggregating facet results for a given search query. Facets are a way of categorizing search results based on certain criteria, such as language, location, or user. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to retrieve the top-k facet results for a given facet name.\n\nThe class extends the `AbstractResultsCollector` class and overrides its methods to implement the facet collection logic. The `doCollect` method is called for each document that matches the search query, and it updates the facet counts for the current document. The `getFacetResults` method retrieves the top-k facet results for a given facet name by aggregating the facet counts across all documents that matched the search query.\n\nThe `FacetResultsCollector` class uses several helper classes to implement its functionality. The `FacetScorer` class is responsible for scoring the facet counts for each document based on the search query and ranking options. The `HashingAndPruningFacetAccumulator` class is responsible for accumulating the facet counts for each document and pruning the results to the top-k facets. The `FacetIDMap` class is responsible for mapping facet names to facet IDs.\n\nThe `FacetResultsCollector` class is used in the larger project to provide facet search functionality for Twitter search queries. It is part of a larger search system that includes indexing, ranking, and filtering components. The facet results are used to provide additional context and insights into the search results, and they can be used to refine the search query or to explore related topics. The class can be used by other components of the search system to retrieve facet results for a given search query. For example, the search results page could display the top-k facets for a given search query, allowing users to explore related topics and refine their search.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Java implementation of a facet search algorithm for Twitter's Earlybird search engine.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external libraries including Google Guava, Twitter Common, and Apache Lucene.\n\n3. What is the role of the `FacetScorer` class in this code?\n- The `FacetScorer` class is responsible for scoring and ranking facet results based on the search query and ranking options. It is used to create a `FacetAccumulator` for each facet field and increment the counts for each matching document."

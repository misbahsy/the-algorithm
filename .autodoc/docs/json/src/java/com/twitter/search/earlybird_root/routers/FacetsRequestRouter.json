  "summary": "The FacetsRequestRouter class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for forwarding all Facets traffic to the realtime cluster. \n\nThe class extends the RequestRouter class and overrides its route method. The route method takes an EarlybirdRequestContext object as input and returns a Future object of EarlybirdResponse type. The EarlybirdRequestContext object contains the request context information, such as the query parameters, headers, and other metadata. The EarlybirdResponse object contains the response data, such as the search results, error messages, and other information.\n\nThe FacetsRequestRouter class has two constructor parameters: a Service object of EarlybirdRequestContext and EarlybirdResponse types, and an EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter object. The Service object is annotated with the @Named annotation and InjectionNames.REALTIME value, which means that it is a dependency injection that provides the realtime cluster service. The EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter object is annotated with the @Named annotation and FacetsRequestRouterModule.TIME_RANGE_FILTER value, which means that it is a dependency injection that provides the time range filter.\n\nThe constructor initializes the realtime field by applying the time range filter to the realtime cluster service using the andThen method of the EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter class. The andThen method returns a new Service object that applies the time range filter before forwarding the request to the realtime cluster service.\n\nThe FacetsRequestRouter class is used by the SuperRoot class to route the Facets traffic to the realtime cluster. The SuperRoot class creates a new instance of the FacetsRequestRouter class and calls its route method to forward the Facets traffic to the realtime cluster. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nService<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> realtime = new RealtimeService();\nEarlybirdTimeRangeFilter timeRangeFilter = new EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter();\nFacetsRequestRouter router = new FacetsRequestRouter(realtime, timeRangeFilter);\n\nEarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> response = router.route(requestContext);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code is a Java class that represents a request router for a project called The Algorithm from Twitter. Specifically, it is a router for Facets traffic that forwards all traffic to the realtime cluster.\n   \n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code depends on several other classes and interfaces from the same project, including EarlybirdResponse, EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdTimeRangeFilter, and RequestRouter. It also uses the Finagle library's Service interface.\n\n3. What is the role of the @Inject and @Named annotations in this code?\n   - The @Inject annotation is used to indicate that the FacetsRequestRouter class should be instantiated and managed by a dependency injection framework. The @Named annotation is used to specify the name of a particular dependency that should be injected into the constructor of the FacetsRequestRouter class."

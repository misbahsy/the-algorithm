  "summary": "The `KafkaRawRecord` class represents the raw data contained in a Kafka record. It has two fields: `data`, which is a byte array containing the actual data, and `readAtTimestampMs`, which is a long representing the timestamp at which the record was read.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to handle incoming data from Kafka. When a record is read from Kafka, it is represented as a `KafkaRawRecord` object, which can then be processed further by other parts of the system.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a Kafka topic called `tweets` that contains raw tweet data. We could use the `KafkaRawRecord` class to read records from this topic and then pass them to a processing pipeline that extracts relevant information from the tweets and stores it in a database.\n\nHere is an example of how we might use the `KafkaRawRecord` class to read records from a Kafka topic:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;\nimport com.twitter.search.ingester.model.KafkaRawRecord;\n\n// create a Kafka consumer\nKafkaConsumer<String, byte[]> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);\n\n// subscribe to the tweets topic\nconsumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList(\"tweets\"));\n\n// read records from the topic\nwhile (true) {\n  ConsumerRecords<String, byte[]> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));\n  for (ConsumerRecord<String, byte[]> record : records) {\n    KafkaRawRecord rawRecord = new KafkaRawRecord(record.value(), record.timestamp());\n    // process the raw record further\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a Kafka consumer and subscribe to the `tweets` topic. We then read records from the topic using the `poll` method, and for each record, we create a `KafkaRawRecord` object and pass it to a processing pipeline.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class?\n- This class represents the raw data in a Kafka record.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the constructor?\n- The constructor takes in two parameters: a byte array representing the data and a long integer representing the timestamp in milliseconds when the data was read.\n\n3. What methods are available in this class?\n- This class has two methods: `getData()` which returns the byte array representing the data, and `getReadAtTimestampMs()` which returns the timestamp in milliseconds when the data was read."

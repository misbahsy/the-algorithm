  "summary": "The `SensitiveResultsTrackingFilter` class is a framework for tracking sensitive results in the Earlybird root project. It is an abstract class that extends the `SimpleFilter` class and takes in two parameters: `typeName` and `logDetails`. The `typeName` parameter is used to distinguish different kinds of sensitive results in the log, while the `logDetails` parameter is used to control whether to log expensive information.\n\nThis class has several abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. These methods include `getLogger()`, which returns the logger that the sensitive results can write to, `getSensitiveQueryCounter()`, which returns the counter that counts the number of queries with sensitive results, `getSensitiveResultsCounter()`, which returns the counter that counts the number of sensitive results, `getSensitiveResults()`, which defines how the sensitive results are identified, and `getExceptedResults()`, which returns a set of tweets that should be excluded from the sensitive results set.\n\nThe `apply()` method is overridden in this class and takes in two parameters: `requestContext` and `service`. It returns a `Future` object that contains an `EarlybirdResponse`. The `response` object is then passed to a `FutureEventListener` that listens for the success or failure of the response. If the response is successful and contains search results, the `getSensitiveResults()` method is called to identify any sensitive results. The `getExceptedResults()` method is also called to exclude any tweets that should not be considered sensitive. If there are any sensitive results, the `logContent()` method is called to log the results.\n\nThe `logContent()` method takes in three parameters: `requestContext`, `earlybirdResponse`, and `statusIds`. It logs the sensitive results along with other information such as the parsed query, request, and response. If `logDetails` is set to false, it only logs the sensitive results and the parsed query.\n\nOverall, this class provides a framework for tracking sensitive results in the Earlybird root project. It can be extended to track different kinds of sensitive results and can be used to log information about these results. Below is an example of how this class can be extended:\n\n```\npublic class MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter extends SensitiveResultsTrackingFilter {\n\n  public MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter(final String typeName, boolean logDetails) {\n    super(typeName, logDetails);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected Logger getLogger() {\n    // return logger for MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected SearchCounter getSensitiveQueryCounter() {\n    // return search counter for MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected SearchCounter getSensitiveResultsCounter() {\n    // return search counter for MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected Set<Long> getSensitiveResults(\n      EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext,\n      EarlybirdResponse earlybirdResponse) throws Exception {\n    // identify sensitive results for MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected Set<Long> getExceptedResults(EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext) {\n    // exclude tweets from sensitive results set for MySensitiveResultsTrackingFilter\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a filter for the Earlybird root project to track sensitive results.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of this code?\n- The inputs are an EarlybirdRequestContext object and a Service object that takes EarlybirdRequestContext and returns EarlybirdResponse. The output is a Future object that contains EarlybirdResponse.\n\n3. What are the abstract methods in this code and how are they implemented?\n- There are five abstract methods in this code: getLogger(), getSensitiveQueryCounter(), getSensitiveResults(), getExceptedResults(), and apply(). These methods are implemented in subclasses of SensitiveResultsTrackingFilter."

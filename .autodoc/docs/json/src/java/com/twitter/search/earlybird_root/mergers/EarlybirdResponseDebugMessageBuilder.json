  "summary": "The `EarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder` class is responsible for collecting debug messages to attach to an `EarlybirdResponse`. The class contains methods for appending debug messages, logging warnings, and logging response debug information. The debug messages are stored in a `StringBuilder` and can be retrieved using the `debugString()` method. \n\nThe class also contains methods for logging information about the success or failure of a search query. For example, the `logBelowSuccessThreshold` method logs a warning message if the number of successful responses returned from partitions is lower than a specified threshold. The `logResponseDebugInfo` method logs debug information about an `EarlybirdResponse`, including the response code and any search results.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to provide additional information about search queries and responses for debugging purposes. The debug messages collected by this class can be used to identify and diagnose issues with search queries and responses. The class is part of a larger system for searching Twitter data called Earlybird, which likely includes other classes for processing search queries and responses. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nEarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();\n// set request parameters\nEarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder builder = new EarlybirdResponseDebugMessageBuilder(request);\n// perform search query\nEarlybirdResponse response = performSearchQuery(request);\nbuilder.logResponseDebugInfo(request, \"partitionTierName\", response);\nString debugString = builder.debugString();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is responsible for collecting debug messages to attach to EarlybirdResponse.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses Guava and SLF4J libraries.\n\n3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?\n- This code tracks two metrics: `insufficient_valid_partition_responses_count` and `valid_partition_response_count`."

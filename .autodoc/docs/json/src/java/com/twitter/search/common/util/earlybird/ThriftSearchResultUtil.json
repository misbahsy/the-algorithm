  "summary": "The `ThriftSearchResultUtil` class contains a set of static methods for constructing and manipulating `ThriftSearchResult` objects. These objects are used to represent search results in the Earlybird search system. \n\nThe class contains several useful methods for working with `ThriftSearchResults` objects, including `numResults`, which returns the number of results in a `ThriftSearchResults` object, and `getTweetIds`, which returns a list of tweet IDs from a `ThriftSearchResults` object. \n\nThe class also contains several useful `Predicate` objects for filtering `ThriftSearchResult` objects based on various criteria, such as whether a tweet is offensive or whether it is a top tweet. \n\nOther methods in the class include `getTweetMetadataMap`, which returns a map of tweet IDs to their corresponding metadata, and `removeDuplicates`, which removes duplicate `ThriftSearchResult` objects from a list. \n\nOverall, the `ThriftSearchResultUtil` class provides a set of useful utility methods for working with `ThriftSearchResult` objects in the Earlybird search system. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nThriftSearchResults results = ... // some search results\nint numResults = ThriftSearchResultUtil.numResults(results);\nList<Long> tweetIds = ThriftSearchResultUtil.getTweetIds(results);\nList<ThriftSearchResult> filteredResults = results.getResults().stream()\n    .filter(ThriftSearchResultUtil.IS_TOP_TWEET)\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code contains static methods for constructing and manipulating ThriftSearchResult objects.\n\n2. What are some of the useful Predicates defined in this code?\n- The code defines Predicates for identifying offensive tweets, top tweets, tweets from full archive, and NSFW tweets.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the removeDuplicates method?\n- The removeDuplicates method removes duplicates from a list of ThriftSearchResults using an ExactDuplicateFilter."

  "summary": "The `ModelLoader` class is responsible for loading `LightweightLinearModel` objects from a directory and providing an interface for reloading them periodically. The models must support the same features, defined by a `FeatureContext`, and are identified by the name of the subdirectory. The required directory structure is `/path/to/base-directory/one-model/model.tsv`, where each subdirectory must contain a file named `model.tsv` in the format required by `LightweightLinearModel`.\n\nThe `ModelLoader` class exports four counters: `last_loaded`, which is the timestamp (in ms) when the last model was loaded; `num_models`, which is the number of models currently loaded; `num_loads`, which is the number of successful model loads; and `num_errors`, which is the number of errors that occurred while loading the models.\n\nThe `getModel` method returns an `Optional` containing the `LightweightLinearModel` object with the given name, if it exists.\n\nThe `run` method loads the models from the base directory. It doesn't load a model if its file has not been modified since the last time it was loaded. This method doesn't delete previously loaded models if their directories are not available.\n\nThe `forDirectory` method creates an instance that loads models from a directory (local or from HDFS), while the `forHdfsDirectory` method creates an instance that loads models from HDFS.\n\nThe `IS_MODEL_DIR` filter is used to check if a file is a valid model directory. It returns `true` if the file is a directory and contains a readable `model.tsv` file.\n\nOverall, the `ModelLoader` class provides a convenient way to load and manage `LightweightLinearModel` objects from a directory, making it easier to use them in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ModelLoader` class?\n- The `ModelLoader` class loads `LightweightLinearModel` objects from a directory and provides an interface for reloading them periodically.\n\n2. What is the required directory structure for the models?\n- The required directory structure is a base directory containing subdirectories, where each subdirectory contains a file named `model.tsv` in the format required by `LightweightLinearModel`.\n\n3. What metrics are exported by the `ModelLoader` class?\n- The `ModelLoader` class exports 4 counters: `last_loaded`, `num_models`, `num_loads`, and `num_errors`."

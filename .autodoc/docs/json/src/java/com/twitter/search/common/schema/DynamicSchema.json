  "summary": "The DynamicSchema class is an implementation of the Schema interface that allows for minor version increments at runtime. It is designed to be used in a larger project that requires the ability to update the schema without downtime. \n\nThe class contains a single constructor that takes an ImmutableSchema object as a parameter. The ImmutableSchema object represents the current schema and is stored in an AtomicReference object. The getSchemaSnapshot() method returns a snapshot of the current schema.\n\nThe updateSchema() method is used to update the schema. It takes an ImmutableSchema object as a parameter and checks if the major version number of the new schema matches the current schema. If it does not match, a SchemaUpdateException is thrown. If it matches, the method checks if the minor version number of the new schema is greater than the current schema. If it is not greater, a SchemaUpdateException is thrown. If the new schema is valid, the method updates the schema reference in the AtomicReference object.\n\nThe rest of the methods in the DynamicSchema class are delegated to the underlying ImmutableSchema object. These methods provide access to the schema's Lucene field information, facets configuration, default analyzer, field information, facet fields, version information, feature configuration, and more.\n\nOverall, the DynamicSchema class provides a way to update the schema of a larger project without downtime. It is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes that implement the Schema interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?\n- This code is a schema implementation that allows minor version increments at runtime. It is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to update the schema reference inside the `DynamicSchema` class.\n\n2. What is the `ImmutableSchema` class and how is it related to the `DynamicSchema` class?\n- The `ImmutableSchema` class is the underlying schema that the `DynamicSchema` class delegates its methods to. The `DynamicSchema` class holds an atomic reference to an instance of `ImmutableSchema` and allows for updates to the schema at runtime.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SchemaUpdateException` class and when is it thrown?\n- The `SchemaUpdateException` class is thrown when a schema update fails due to an unsupported major version update or a backward minor version update. It is thrown by the `updateSchema` method in the `DynamicSchema` class."

  "summary": "The MetadataTrackingFilter class is a filter that tracks engagement statistics returned from Earlybirds. It extends the SimpleFilter class and overrides the apply method to add event listeners to the response. The purpose of this filter is to extract engagement statistics from the search results returned by Earlybirds and track them for each client. \n\nThe filter extracts engagement statistics such as favorite count, reply count, retweet count, and score from the search results. It then adds these statistics to a moving average for each engagement signal. The moving average is exported as a metric that can be used to monitor the engagement signals over time. \n\nIn addition to tracking engagement signals, the filter also exports per-client average scores. It uses a loading cache to store the average scores for each client. The cache is populated using a CacheLoader that loads the average score for a client when it is not present in the cache. \n\nThe filter is used in the larger Earlybird project to track engagement signals and average scores for each client. This information can be used to monitor the performance of the search results and to optimize the search algorithm. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nMetadataTrackingFilter filter = new MetadataTrackingFilter();\nService<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> service = new EarlybirdService();\nService<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> filteredService = filter.andThen(service);\nEarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> response = filteredService.apply(request);\n```",

  "summary": "The `SimpleSearchResults` class is a subclass of `SearchResultsInfo` and is used to store and retrieve search results. It has two constructors, one that takes an integer `size` and another that takes a `List` of `Hit` objects. The `size` parameter is used to initialize the `hits` array with a fixed size, while the `List` constructor initializes the `hits` array with the size of the `List` and populates it with the `Hit` objects from the `List`.\n\nThe `SimpleSearchResults` class has several methods to retrieve information about the search results. The `hits()` method returns an array of `Hit` objects, while the `numHits()` method returns the number of hits in the search results. The `setNumHits()` method can be used to set the number of hits in the search results, and the `getHit()` method can be used to retrieve a specific `Hit` object from the `hits` array.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to store and retrieve search results from the Twitter API. For example, a search query could be executed using the Twitter API, and the resulting `List` of `Hit` objects could be passed to the `SimpleSearchResults` constructor to create a `SimpleSearchResults` object. This object could then be used to display the search results to the user or to perform further analysis on the search results. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nList<Hit> hits = twitterApi.search(\"example query\");\nSimpleSearchResults results = new SimpleSearchResults(hits);\nSystem.out.println(\"Number of hits: \" + results.numHits());\nSystem.out.println(\"First hit: \" + results.getHit(0));\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SearchResultsInfo` class that `SimpleSearchResults` extends?\n- It is not clear from this code snippet what the `SearchResultsInfo` class does or what its purpose is.\n\n2. What is the `Hit` class and how is it used in this code?\n- The `Hit` class is referenced multiple times in this code, but it is not defined in this file. A smart developer might want to know what this class is and how it is used in the context of this code.\n\n3. What is the difference between the two constructors for `SimpleSearchResults`?\n- One constructor takes an integer `size` as a parameter, while the other takes a `List` of `Hit` objects. A smart developer might want to know why there are two different constructors and when to use each one."

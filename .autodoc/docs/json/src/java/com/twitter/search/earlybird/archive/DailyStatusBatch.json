  "summary": "The `DailyStatusBatch` class represents a day's worth of statuses (tweets) for multiple hash partitions. It contains metadata about the tweets, such as the status count, min status id, and max status id. Note that this class does not contain the actual tweet data. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to check for the presence of the `_SUCCESS` file in the \"statuses\" subdirectory and extract the metadata for each hash partition. It also provides methods to add a partition, get a partition, and check if the batch is valid. \n\nThe `DailyStatusBatch` class is used in the larger project to manage and process tweet data. It is used to load tweet data for a specific day and hash partition, and to check if the tweet data is valid. This class is also used to serialize and deserialize tweet data to and from JSON format. \n\nExample usage:\n```\n// Create a DailyStatusBatch object for a specific date and number of hash partitions\nDailyStatusBatch batch = new DailyStatusBatch(date, numHashPartitions, statusPath, hdfs);\n\n// Add a partition to the batch\nPartitionedBatch partition = batch.addPartition(hdfs, dayPath, hashPartitionID);\n\n// Get a partition from the batch\nPartitionedBatch partition = batch.getPartition(hashPartitionID);\n\n// Check if the batch is valid\nboolean isValid = batch.isValid();\n\n// Serialize the batch to JSON\nString json = batch.serializeToJson();\n\n// Deserialize a batch from JSON\nDailyStatusBatch batch = DailyStatusBatch.deserializeFromJson(json);\n```",

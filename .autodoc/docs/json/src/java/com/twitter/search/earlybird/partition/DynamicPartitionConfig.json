  "summary": "The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class is responsible for keeping track of an up-to-date `PartitionConfig` object. The `PartitionConfig` object may be periodically reloaded from ZooKeeper. The `DynamicPartitionConfig` class is practically a singleton in the Earlybird app. If you need a consistent view of the current partition configuration, make sure to grab a reference to a single `PartitionConfig` using `getCurrentPartitionConfig()` and reuse that object.\n\nThe `DynamicPartitionConfig` class has two constructors, one of which takes an initial `PartitionConfig` object. The `getCurrentPartitionConfig()` method returns the current `PartitionConfig` object. The `setCurrentPartitionConfig()` method verifies that the new partition config is compatible with the old one, and if it is, updates the number of replicas per partition based on the new partition config.\n\nThe `DynamicPartitionConfig` class has three static variables, `FAILED_UPDATE_COUNTER_NAME`, `SUCCESSFUL_UPDATE_COUNTER`, and `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION`. `FAILED_UPDATE_COUNTER_NAME` and `SUCCESSFUL_UPDATE_COUNTER` are `SearchCounter` objects that keep track of the number of failed and successful updates, respectively. `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` is a `SearchLongGauge` object that keeps track of the number of replicas in the hash partition.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `DynamicPartitionConfig` class:\n\n```\nPartitionConfig initialConfig = new PartitionConfig();\nDynamicPartitionConfig dynamicPartitionConfig = new DynamicPartitionConfig(initialConfig);\nPartitionConfig currentPartitionConfig = dynamicPartitionConfig.getCurrentPartitionConfig();\n// Use currentPartitionConfig object\nPartitionConfig newPartitionConfig = new PartitionConfig();\ndynamicPartitionConfig.setCurrentPartitionConfig(newPartitionConfig);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `DynamicPartitionConfig` that keeps track of an up-to-date `PartitionConfig` and allows for updating the number of replicas per partition based on the new partition config.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has external dependencies on `com.google.common.base.Preconditions`, `org.slf4j.Logger`, `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`, `com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchCounter`, and `com.twitter.search.common.metrics.SearchLongGauge`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` metric?\n- The `NUM_REPLICAS_IN_HASH_PARTITION` metric is a `SearchLongGauge` that keeps track of the number of replicas per partition in the hash partition. It is assumed to be practically a singleton in the Earlybird app."

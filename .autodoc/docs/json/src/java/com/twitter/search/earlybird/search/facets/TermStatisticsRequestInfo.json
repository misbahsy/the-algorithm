  "summary": "The `TermStatisticsRequestInfo` class is a part of the Earlybird search facets package and is used to create a new instance of a term statistics request. This class extends the `SearchRequestInfo` class and contains a list of term requests and histogram settings. \n\nThe `TermStatisticsRequestInfo` constructor takes in a `ThriftSearchQuery` object, a `Query` object, a `ThriftTermStatisticsRequest` object, and a `TerminationTracker` object. The `ThriftSearchQuery` object contains the search query parameters, the `Query` object contains the Lucene query, the `ThriftTermStatisticsRequest` object contains the term statistics request parameters, and the `TerminationTracker` object is used to track the termination of the search. \n\nThe `termRequests` list contains the term requests that are used to calculate the term statistics. The `histogramSettings` object contains the settings for the histogram that is returned with the term statistics. \n\nThe `calculateMaxHitsToProcess` method is overridden to calculate the maximum number of hits to process based on the search query parameters. If the termination parameters are not set, the default value is set to all hits. \n\nThe `getTermRequests` method returns the list of term requests, the `getHistogramSettings` method returns the histogram settings, and the `isReturnHistogram` method returns a boolean indicating whether or not a histogram is returned with the term statistics. \n\nThe `FACET_URL_FIELDS_TO_NORMALIZE` set contains the field names that are used to normalize the URLs in the term requests. The `termRequests` list is iterated through, and the URLs in the fields specified in the `FACET_URL_FIELDS_TO_NORMALIZE` set are normalized using the `URLUtils.normalizePath` method. The text terms are also normalized using the `NormalizerHelper.normalizeWithUnknownLocale` method. \n\nOverall, the `TermStatisticsRequestInfo` class is used to create a new instance of a term statistics request and contains methods to retrieve the term requests, histogram settings, and whether or not a histogram is returned with the term statistics. It also normalizes the URLs and text terms in the term requests.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `TermStatisticsRequestInfo` that extends `SearchRequestInfo` and contains methods for getting term requests, histogram settings, and a boolean indicating whether to return a histogram.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries, including Google Guava and Apache Lucene.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `FACET_URL_FIELDS_TO_NORMALIZE` set?\n- This set contains the names of fields that correspond to URLs in the EarlybirdFieldConstants class, and is used to determine which URLs should have their trailing slashes removed during normalization."

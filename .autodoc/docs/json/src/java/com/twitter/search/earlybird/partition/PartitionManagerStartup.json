  "summary": "The `PartitionManagerStartup` class is responsible for starting and indexing data for a partition using a `PartitionManager`. This class implements the `EarlybirdStartup` interface, which requires the implementation of a `start()` method that returns a `Closeable` object. \n\nIn the `start()` method, the `schedule()` method of the `PartitionManager` is called to schedule the partition. Then, a while loop is executed until the `EarlybirdStatus` status code is set to `CURRENT`. Within the loop, the status code is checked to see if it is set to `STOPPING`, in which case the `PartitionManager` is returned. Otherwise, the `clock` object waits for 1000 milliseconds before checking the status code again. \n\nAdditionally, the loop logs a message to the console every 120 seconds to indicate that the Thrift port is closed until Earlybird, both indexing and query cache, is current. If the `clock` object is interrupted during the wait, an `EarlybirdStartupException` is thrown.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger Earlybird project to manage the startup and indexing of data for a partition. It is possible that multiple instances of this class are used to manage multiple partitions. The `PartitionManager` object passed to the constructor likely contains information about the partition, such as the data to be indexed and the indexing strategy to be used. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nClock clock = new SystemClock();\nPartitionManager partitionManager = new MyPartitionManager();\nPartitionManagerStartup startup = new PartitionManagerStartup(clock, partitionManager);\nCloseable closeable = startup.start();\n// Use partitionManager to perform indexing and querying operations\ncloseable.close();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is responsible for starting and indexing data for a partition using a PartitionManager.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several external libraries, including SLF4J, Twitter Common Util, and Thrift.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior of the `start()` method?\n- The `start()` method schedules the partition manager, waits for EarlybirdStatus to reach the CURRENT state, and logs a message every 120 seconds until that state is reached. Once the state is reached, it returns the partition manager."

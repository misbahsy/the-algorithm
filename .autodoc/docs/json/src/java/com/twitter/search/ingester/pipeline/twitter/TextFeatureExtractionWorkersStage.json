  "summary": "The `TextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage` class is a stage in a data processing pipeline that extracts text features from Twitter messages. It implements the `TwitterBaseStage` class and processes `TwitterMessage` objects. The stage uses a thread pool to parallelize the processing of messages. \n\nThe stage has a queue of `TwitterMessage` objects with a maximum size of 100. When a message is received, it is added to the queue. The thread pool has five threads, each of which runs a `FeatureExtractorWorker` that takes messages from the queue and processes them. The `tryToParse` method of the stage parses the text of the message using a `TweetParser` and merges the parsed features into the message. If parsing fails, the message is not passed to the next stage of the pipeline. \n\nThe stage also has several metrics that are exported using the `SearchRateCounter` and `SearchCustomGauge` classes. These metrics include the number of slow tweets, the size of the message queue, the number of thread errors, and the number of thread interruptions. \n\nOverall, the purpose of this stage is to extract text features from Twitter messages and pass them to the next stage of the pipeline. The use of a thread pool allows for parallel processing of messages, which can improve the performance of the pipeline. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\nTextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage stage = new TextFeatureExtractionWorkersStage();\nstage.init();\nTwitterMessage message = new TwitterMessage();\nmessage.setText(\"This is a test tweet.\");\nstage.process(message);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a stage in a pipeline for extracting text features from Twitter messages.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries including Guava, Apache Commons Pipeline, SLF4J, and Twitter Search Common.\n\n3. What metrics are being tracked in this code?\n- This code tracks several metrics including slow tweet count, queue size, thread error count, and thread interruption count."

  "summary": "The code defines an abstract class called `FacetRankingModule` that serves as an extension point for post-processing facet search results in the EarlybirdLuceneSearcher. The purpose of this class is to allow for re-ranking or sorting of facet results before they are returned. \n\nThe class contains a static list called `REGISTERED_RANKING_MODULES` that holds instances of classes that implement the `FacetRankingModule` abstract class. Currently, the list only contains an instance of the `SimpleCountRankingModule` class. \n\nThe `prepareResults` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that extends `FacetRankingModule`. This method takes in two parameters: `hits`, which is an instance of `EarlybirdLuceneSearcher.FacetSearchResults`, and `facetCountState`, which is an instance of `FacetCountState<ThriftFacetFieldResults>`. The purpose of this method is to prepare the `ThriftFacetFieldResults` in `facetCountState` before they are returned. \n\nOverall, this code serves as a framework for implementing custom facet ranking modules in the EarlybirdLuceneSearcher. By extending the `FacetRankingModule` class and implementing the `prepareResults` method, developers can customize the way facet search results are ranked and sorted. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\npublic class CustomRankingModule extends FacetRankingModule {\n  @Override\n  public void prepareResults(EarlybirdLuceneSearcher.FacetSearchResults hits, FacetCountState<ThriftFacetFieldResults> facetCountState) {\n    // custom ranking logic here\n  }\n}\n\n// register custom ranking module\nFacetRankingModule.REGISTERED_RANKING_MODULES.add(new CustomRankingModule());\n\n// use EarlybirdLuceneSearcher to perform facet search\nEarlybirdLuceneSearcher searcher = new EarlybirdLuceneSearcher();\nsearcher.searchFacets(query, facetFields);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `FacetRankingModule` class?\n- The `FacetRankingModule` class is an abstract class that provides an extension point for post-processing facet results, such as re-ranking or sorting.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `REGISTERED_RANKING_MODULES` list?\n- The `REGISTERED_RANKING_MODULES` list is a static list that contains instances of `FacetRankingModule` subclasses. It is used to keep track of all registered ranking modules.\n\n3. What is the role of the `prepareResults` method?\n- The `prepareResults` method is an abstract method that takes in search results and facet count state, and prepares the facet field results for return. It provides an extension point for post-processing facet results."

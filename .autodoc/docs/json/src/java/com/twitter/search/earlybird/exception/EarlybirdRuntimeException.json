  "summary": "The code above defines a custom exception class called EarlybirdRuntimeException. This class extends the RuntimeException class, which means that it is an unchecked exception. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to handle runtime exceptions that may occur during the execution of the Earlybird search algorithm. The Earlybird search algorithm is a Twitter search engine that is designed to find tweets that match a specific set of criteria. \n\nIf an exception occurs during the execution of the Earlybird search algorithm, this custom exception class will be used to handle it. The EarlybirdRuntimeException class takes a Throwable object as a parameter in its constructor. This Throwable object represents the cause of the exception that occurred. \n\nBy using a custom exception class, the Earlybird search algorithm can handle exceptions in a more specific and controlled way. This can help to improve the overall reliability and stability of the search engine. \n\nHere is an example of how this custom exception class might be used in the Earlybird search algorithm:\n\ntry {\n  // code that executes the Earlybird search algorithm\n} catch (Exception e) {\n  throw new EarlybirdRuntimeException(e);\n}\n\nIn this example, the Earlybird search algorithm is executed within a try-catch block. If an exception occurs, a new instance of the EarlybirdRuntimeException class is created and the original exception is passed as a parameter. This new exception is then thrown, which will cause the program to exit the current block and handle the exception in a more specific way.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class?\n   This class is a custom exception class called EarlybirdRuntimeException that extends the RuntimeException class.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"Throwable cause\" parameter in the constructor?\n   The \"Throwable cause\" parameter is used to pass the exception that caused this exception to be thrown. This allows for better error handling and debugging.\n\n3. Where is this exception class used in the project?\n   Without further context, it is impossible to determine where this exception class is used in the project. It could be used in various parts of the codebase to handle runtime exceptions."

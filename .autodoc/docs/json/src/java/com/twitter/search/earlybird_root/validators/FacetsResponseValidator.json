  "summary": "The FacetsResponseValidator class is a validator for facets responses in the Earlybird search system. It is used to ensure that the response from a search query contains the necessary fields and data to be considered a valid facets response. \n\nThe class implements the ServiceResponseValidator interface, which requires the implementation of a validate method that takes an EarlybirdResponse object and returns a Future<EarlybirdResponse> object. The EarlybirdResponse object contains the search results and facet results from a search query.\n\nThe constructor for the FacetsResponseValidator class takes an EarlybirdCluster object as a parameter. This object represents the cluster that the search query was executed on.\n\nThe validate method first checks if the search results and results field are set in the EarlybirdResponse object. If they are not set, an IllegalStateException is thrown with a message indicating that the search results were not set for the specified cluster.\n\nNext, the method checks if the facetResults field is set in the EarlybirdResponse object. If it is not set, an IllegalStateException is thrown with a message indicating that the facetResults field was not set for the specified cluster.\n\nFinally, the method checks if there are any facet fields set in the facetResults field of the EarlybirdResponse object. If there are no facet fields set, an IllegalStateException is thrown with a message indicating that there are no facet fields set for the specified cluster.\n\nIf all of the checks pass, the method returns a Future<EarlybirdResponse> object with the original EarlybirdResponse object.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Earlybird search system to ensure that the facets response from a search query is valid and contains the necessary data. It can be used in conjunction with other validators to ensure that the entire search response is valid. \n\nExample usage:\n\nEarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();\nEarlybirdResponse response = new EarlybirdResponse();\n// set search results and facet results in response object\nFacetsResponseValidator validator = new FacetsResponseValidator(cluster);\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> validatedResponse = validator.validate(response);",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a validator for facets responses in the Earlybird search system from Twitter.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports two dependencies: `com.twitter.search.common.schema.earlybird.EarlybirdCluster` and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift.EarlybirdResponse`.\n\n3. What does the `validate` method do?\n- The `validate` method takes an `EarlybirdResponse` object as input and checks if it has search results and facet results set. If not, it throws an exception with a message that includes the name of the EarlybirdCluster object passed to the constructor. If everything is set correctly, it returns the input response object."

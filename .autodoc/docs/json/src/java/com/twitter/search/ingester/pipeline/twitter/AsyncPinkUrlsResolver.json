  "summary": "The `AsyncPinkUrlsResolver` class is responsible for resolving compressed URLs via Pink asynchronously. The class takes in a `Storer.ServiceIface` object, a `String` representing the Pink client ID, and constructs a `Mask` object to set the resolution, HTML basics, and URL direct info. \n\nThe `resolveUrls` method takes in a collection of URLs to resolve and returns a `Future` map of resolved URLs. If the input collection is null or empty, the method returns an empty map. The method creates a `UrlReadRequest` object with the input URLs, Pink client ID, and mask. It then calls the `storerClient.read` method with the request and maps the response to a `Map` of resolved URLs. \n\nThe resolved URLs are added to the map only if they are considered resolved by the `ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils.isResolved` method. The `ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils.getUrlInfo` method is used to get the URL info for each resolved URL. \n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to resolve compressed URLs in tweets or other social media posts. The resolved URLs can then be used for further analysis or processing. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nStorer.ServiceIface storerClient = new Storer.ServiceIface();\nString pinkClientId = \"12345\";\nAsyncPinkUrlsResolver resolver = new AsyncPinkUrlsResolver(storerClient, pinkClientId);\n\nCollection<String> urls = Arrays.asList(\"https://t.co/abc123\", \"https://t.co/def456\");\nFuture<Map<String, ResolveCompressedUrlsUtils.UrlInfo>> resolvedUrls = resolver.resolveUrls(urls);\n\nresolvedUrls.onSuccess(result -> {\n  // do something with resolved URLs\n});\n\nresolvedUrls.onFailure(error -> {\n  // handle error\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is for resolving compressed URLs via Pink asynchronously.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has external dependencies on Google Guava and Twitter Pink Floyd Thrift.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `resolveUrls` method?\n- The `resolveUrls` method expects a collection of URLs as input and returns a future map of resolved URLs."

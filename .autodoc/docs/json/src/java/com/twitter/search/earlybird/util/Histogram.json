  "summary": "The Histogram class is a utility class that provides a histogram of int values with arbitrary buckets. It keeps a count for each bucket and a sum of values for each bucket. The histogram view is returned as a list of Histogram.Entry objects. \n\nThe class is not thread-safe. It has two constructors, one of which takes an array of doubles representing the bucket boundaries. The other constructor takes no arguments and creates a single bin for all items. \n\nThe addItem method adds the given item to the appropriate bucket. The entries method returns the current view of all the bins. The getTotalCount method returns the total number of items seen, and the getTotalSum method returns the sum of all the items seen. \n\nThe Histogram.Entry class represents a single bin in the histogram. It has several fields, including the bucket name, count, count percent, count cumulative, sum, sum percent, and sum cumulative. The bucket name is a string representation of the bucket boundaries. The count fields represent the number of items in the bin, the count percent is the percentage of items in the bin relative to the total number of items, and the count cumulative is the cumulative percentage of items in the bin and all previous bins. The sum fields represent the sum of the items in the bin, the sum percent is the percentage of the sum of the items in the bin relative to the total sum of all items, and the sum cumulative is the cumulative percentage of the sum of the items in the bin and all previous bins. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to analyze data and generate histograms. For example, it can be used to analyze the distribution of tweet lengths or the frequency of hashtags. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nHistogram histogram = new Histogram(0, 10, 100);\nhistogram.addItem(5);\nhistogram.addItem(15);\nhistogram.addItem(50);\nList<Histogram.Entry> entries = histogram.entries();\nfor (Histogram.Entry entry : entries) {\n  System.out.println(entry.getBucketName() + \": \" + entry.getCount());\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a Histogram class that keeps a count and sum of values for each bucket with arbitrary boundaries, and returns a histogram view as a list of entries.\n\n2. What is the format of the bucket boundaries?\n- The bucket boundaries are inclusive on the upper boundaries. Given buckets of [0, 10, 100], items will be placed in 4 bins: { X <= 0, 0 < X <= 10, 10 < X <= 100, X > 100 }.\n\n3. Is this class thread-safe?\n- No, this class is not thread-safe."

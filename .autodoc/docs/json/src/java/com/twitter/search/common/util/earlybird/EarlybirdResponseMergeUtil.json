  "summary": "The `EarlybirdResponseMergeUtil` class provides utility methods for merging `EarlybirdResponse` objects, which are responses to search queries in the Earlybird search system. The class contains several static methods that can be used to manipulate and merge search results. \n\nThe `addResultsToList` method adds the results from an `EarlybirdResponse` object to a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects. The method takes three parameters: a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects, an `EarlybirdResponse` object, and a `ThriftTweetSource` object. The method returns `true` if the `EarlybirdResponse` object is not null and has results, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe `distinctByStatusId` method removes duplicates from a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects based on their status ID. The method takes two parameters: a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects and a `LoadingCache` object that tracks duplicate sources. The method returns a new list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects that contains only distinct results.\n\nThe `markWithTweetSource` method adds a `ThriftTweetSource` object to a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects. The method takes two parameters: a list of `ThriftSearchResult` objects and a `ThriftTweetSource` object.\n\nThe `isValidResponse` method checks if an `EarlybirdResponse` object is valid. The method returns `true` if the `EarlybirdResponse` object is not null, has a successful response code, and has search results.\n\nThe `transformInvalidResponse` method creates a new `EarlybirdResponse` object with a debug message if the original `EarlybirdResponse` object is invalid. The method takes two parameters: an `EarlybirdResponse` object and a debug message.\n\nThe `failedEarlybirdResponse` method creates a new `EarlybirdResponse` object with a response code and debug message. The method takes two parameters: an `EarlybirdResponseCode` object and a debug message.\n\nThe `computeNumResultsToKeep` method computes the number of search results to keep as part of a merge-collection. The method takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object as a parameter and returns an integer value.\n\nOverall, the `EarlybirdResponseMergeUtil` class provides useful utility methods for manipulating and merging search results in the Earlybird search system. These methods can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of search queries in the system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides utility methods for merging EarlybirdResponses, tagging results with ThriftTweetSource, and checking the validity of EarlybirdResponses.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guava, Twitter Common Collections, and SLF4J.\n\n3. What are some potential issues with the distinctByStatusId method?\n- One potential issue with the distinctByStatusId method is that it may not preserve the order of the input results. Additionally, it may not handle null or duplicate ThriftTweetSource values correctly."

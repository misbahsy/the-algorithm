  "summary": "The `AbstractRecencyAndRelevanceRequestRouter` class is a part of a search system that handles routing search requests to different services (realtime, protected realtime, and full archive) based on the request parameters and the availability of the services. It extends the `RequestRouter` class and provides an abstract implementation for handling search requests with recency and relevance ranking modes.\n\nThe main method in this class is `route(EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext)`, which takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns a `Future<EarlybirdResponse>` object. This method first checks the preconditions of the request and then routes the request to the appropriate services based on the request parameters and the availability of the services.\n\nThe routing logic is as follows:\n\n1. If the request has `numResults` set to 0 or `numResultsToReturn` set to 0, return an empty `EarlybirdResponse` without hitting any service.\n2. Determine the availability of realtime, protected realtime, and full archive services based on the request parameters and the availability of the services.\n3. If the realtime service is available, send the request to the realtime service and get the response.\n4. If the protected realtime service is available, modify the request context based on the `followedUserIds` field and send the request to the protected realtime service.\n5. If the full archive service is available, modify the request context based on the `minSearchedStatusID` from the realtime and protected realtime responses, and send the request to the full archive service.\n6. Merge the responses from the services using the `SuperRootResponseMerger` class.\n\nThe class also provides utility methods for adjusting request parameters, determining the availability of services, and handling responses from the services. The responses from the services are merged using the `SuperRootResponseMerger` class, which takes care of deduplication and ranking of the results.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AbstractRecencyAndRelevanceRequestRouter` class?\n   **Answer**: The `AbstractRecencyAndRelevanceRequestRouter` class is responsible for routing requests to different services (realtime, protected realtime, and full archive) based on the request context and merging the results from these services.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the code determine whether to send a request to the full archive cluster?\n   **Answer**: The code determines whether to send a request to the full archive cluster by checking the `shouldSendRequestToFullArchiveCluster` method, which is implemented in the derived classes, and the `getFullArchiveServiceState` method, which checks various conditions and decider keys.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the code handle merging the responses from different services?\n   **Answer**: The code uses the `SuperRootResponseMerger` class to merge the responses from different services. The `mergeResponseFutures` method is called with the futures of the responses from realtime, protected realtime, and full archive services, and it returns a merged `EarlybirdResponse` future."

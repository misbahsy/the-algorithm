  "summary": "The `QueryHitAttributeHelper` class is a helper class that is used to collect field and query node hit attributions. It is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to visit a parsed query to construct a node-to-rank mapping and use a schema to determine all of the possible fields to be tracked. A collector is then created to collect hit attribution. \n\nThe `from` method is the main method of this class. It takes in a `Query` object and a `Schema` object as parameters. It first checks if the query already has node rank annotations on it. If so, it uses those to identify query nodes. Otherwise, it assigns all nodes in-order ranks and uses those to track per-node hit attribution. \n\nThe method then extracts ranks for multi_term_disjunction operators and returns a new `QueryHitAttributeHelper` object with the necessary information to collect hit attribution. \n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nSchema schema = new Schema();\nQuery query = new Query(\"example query\");\nQueryHitAttributeHelper helper = QueryHitAttributeHelper.from(query, schema);\nQuery annotatedQuery = helper.getAnnotatedQuery();\n// use the annotatedQuery and helper to collect hit attribution\n```\n\nOverall, the `QueryHitAttributeHelper` class is an important helper class in The Algorithm from Twitter project that is used to collect hit attribution for a given query.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a helper class for collecting field and query node hit attributions in a parsed query.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on classes from the com.twitter.search.common.schema.base and com.twitter.search.queryparser packages.\n\n3. What is the expected output of using this code?\n- The expected output is a QueryHitAttributeHelper object that can be used to collect hit attributions for a parsed query."

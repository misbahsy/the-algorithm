  "summary": "The `RequestRouter` class is responsible for handling requests in superroot. It contains three inner classes and three methods. The `RequestResponse` class is used to save request and response to be included in debug info. The `route` method is an abstract method that is used to forward a request to different clusters and merge the responses back into one response. The `saveRequestResponse` method is used to save a request (and its response future) to be included in debug info. The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse. The `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse.\n\nThe `RequestRouter` class is used in the larger project to handle requests in superroot. It is an abstract class, which means that it cannot be instantiated. Instead, subclasses of `RequestRouter` are created to handle specific types of requests. These subclasses implement the `route` method to forward requests to different clusters and merge the responses back into one response. The `RequestRouter` class provides methods to save requests and their responses to be included in debug info. The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse. The `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method is used to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```java\n// create a subclass of RequestRouter to handle a specific type of request\npublic class MyRequestRouter extends RequestRouter {\n  @Override\n  public Future<EarlybirdResponse> route(EarlybirdRequestContext requestContext) {\n    // forward request to different clusters and merge responses back into one response\n    // return merged response\n  }\n}\n\n// create an instance of MyRequestRouter\nMyRequestRouter router = new MyRequestRouter();\n\n// handle a request\nEarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext();\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> response = router.route(requestContext);\n\n// attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse\nList<RequestResponse> requestResponses = new ArrayList<>();\nrouter.saveRequestResponse(requestResponses, \"realtime\", requestContext, response);\nresponse = router.maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo(requestResponses, requestContext, response);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an abstract class `RequestRouter` responsible for handling requests in superroot, and contains methods for forwarding requests to different clusters and merging the responses back into one response.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `saveRequestResponse` method?\n- The `saveRequestResponse` method saves a request (and its response future) to be included in debug info.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method?\n- The `maybeAttachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method checks if the request's debug mode is greater than or equal to 4, and if so, calls the `attachSentRequestsToDebugInfo` method to attach saved client requests and their responses to the debug info within the main EarlybirdResponse."

  "summary": "The `EarlybirdCacheCommonModule` class is a module that provides common bindings for cache related modules in the larger project. It contains methods for creating a new Earlybird cache, providing a memcache client, and providing the maximum number of cache results. \n\nThe `createCache` method creates a new cache using the `SearchCacheBuilder` class. It takes in a memcache client, a decider, a cache prefix, a serialized key prefix, a cache expiry time in milliseconds, and maximum key and value byte sizes. It then builds and returns a new cache with the specified parameters. \n\nThe `provideMemCacheClient` method provides a memcache client using the `SearchMemcacheClientFactory` class. It takes in a stats receiver and a service identifier, and returns a new JavaClient. \n\nThe `provideMaxCacheResults` method provides the maximum number of cache results as an integer. \n\nOverall, this module provides common bindings for cache related modules in the larger project, and allows for the creation of new caches and the provision of memcache clients and maximum cache results. \n\nExample usage of this module might include creating a new cache for Earlybird requests and responses, and using the memcache client to store and retrieve cached data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides common bindings for cache related modules in the Earlybird project from Twitter.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Util.\n\n3. What is the significance of the CACHE_VERSION constant?\n- The CACHE_VERSION constant is used as a version identifier for the cache. It is used to ensure that the cache is not corrupted by incompatible changes to the cache format."

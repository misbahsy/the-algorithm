  "summary": "The `EarlybirdThriftRequestDeserializerUtil` class is a tool that deserializes collected thrift requests into a human-readable format. The purpose of this tool is to help developers understand the contents of the thrift request log file. \n\nThe tool takes zero or one parameter, which is the path to the thrift request log file. If no log file is specified, the tool uses the default log file location `/tmp/eb_req.B64`. The tool reads the log file line by line and deserializes each line into an `EarlybirdRequest` object. The `EarlybirdRequest` object is then printed to the console. \n\nThe `main` method is the entry point of the tool. It checks the command-line arguments and sets the log file path accordingly. It then creates a `BufferedReader` to read the log file and reads each line using the `readLine` method. For each line, it calls the `deserializeEBRequest` method to deserialize the line into an `EarlybirdRequest` object. If the deserialization is successful, the `EarlybirdRequest` object is printed to the console. \n\nThe `deserializeEBRequest` method deserializes a single line of the log file into an `EarlybirdRequest` object. It first creates a new `EarlybirdRequest` object and then decodes the line using Base64 decoding. It then uses the `TDeserializer` class to deserialize the decoded bytes into the `EarlybirdRequest` object. If the deserialization fails, an error message is printed to the console. \n\nOverall, this tool is useful for developers who need to understand the contents of the thrift request log file. It provides a simple way to deserialize the log file into human-readable format and print the contents to the console. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```\n$ java com.twitter.search.earlybird.tools.EarlybirdThriftRequestDeserializerUtil /path/to/eb_req.B64\n```\n\nThis command runs the `EarlybirdThriftRequestDeserializerUtil` tool with the specified log file path. The tool reads the log file and prints the deserialized `EarlybirdRequest` objects to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a tool that deserializes collected thrift requests into a human-readable format.\n\n2. How do you run this tool?\n- This tool can be launched from IntelliJ/Eclipse and takes zero or one parameter, which is the path to the thrift request log file. If no log file is specified, the default log file location is used.\n\n3. Is this code thread-safe?\n- No, this code is not thread-safe as it is designed to be run by a single thread in the main() method."

  "summary": "The code above defines a custom exception class called `FlushVersionMismatchException`. This exception extends the `IOException` class, which means that it is a type of input/output exception that can occur when there is an error in reading or writing data. \n\nThe purpose of this custom exception is to handle cases where there is a mismatch between the version of the data being flushed and the version expected by the system. This can happen when there are changes to the data format or structure, and the system is not able to handle the new version. \n\nThis exception class provides three constructors that allow for different types of error messages to be passed in. The first constructor takes a `Throwable` object as a parameter, which means that it can be used to wrap another exception that caused the error. The second constructor takes a `String` message as a parameter, which can be used to provide a custom error message. The third constructor takes both a `String` message and a `Throwable` object as parameters, which allows for both a custom error message and the original exception to be included in the error message.\n\nThis custom exception class can be used in the larger project to handle errors that occur during data flushing. For example, if the system is trying to flush data to a database and encounters a version mismatch error, it can throw this custom exception to provide more information about the error to the user or developer. \n\nHere is an example of how this custom exception class could be used in code:\n\n```\ntry {\n  // code to flush data\n} catch (VersionMismatchException e) {\n  // handle version mismatch error\n  System.out.println(\"Error: \" + e.getMessage());\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `try` block contains code to flush data, and if a `VersionMismatchException` is thrown, the `catch` block will handle the error by printing out the error message.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the FlushVersionMismatchException class?\n    - The FlushVersionMismatchException class is used to handle exceptions related to version mismatches during flushing in the Earlybird search system.\n\n2. What is the difference between the two constructors that take a String parameter?\n    - One constructor takes a single String parameter to set the exception message, while the other constructor takes two parameters - a String message and a Throwable cause.\n\n3. Why does the class extend IOException?\n    - The class extends IOException because it is a checked exception that indicates an I/O problem, which is appropriate for handling errors related to flushing in the Earlybird search system."

  "summary": "The `IndexingResultCounts` class is a helper class used to store counts to be logged. It has four private instance variables: `indexingCalls`, `failureRetriable`, `failureNotRetriable`, and `indexingSuccess`. The class has a default constructor that does nothing. \n\nThe class has a public method `countResult` that takes an argument of type `ISegmentWriter.Result` and updates the internal counts based on the value of the argument. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.FAILURE_NOT_RETRYABLE`, the `failureNotRetriable` count is incremented. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.FAILURE_RETRYABLE`, the `failureRetriable` count is incremented. If the argument is `ISegmentWriter.Result.SUCCESS`, the `indexingSuccess` count is incremented. In all cases, the `indexingCalls` count is incremented.\n\nThe class has four getter methods: `getIndexingCalls`, `getFailureRetriable`, `getFailureNotRetriable`, and `getIndexingSuccess`. These methods return the values of the corresponding instance variables.\n\nThe class also overrides the `toString` method to return a string representation of the counts in a formatted string.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of the results of indexing operations. It provides a way to store and retrieve counts of different types of indexing results, which can be useful for logging and monitoring purposes. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nIndexingResultCounts counts = new IndexingResultCounts();\nISegmentWriter.Result result = ISegmentWriter.Result.SUCCESS;\ncounts.countResult(result);\nSystem.out.println(counts.getIndexingSuccess()); // prints 1\nSystem.out.println(counts.toString()); // prints \"[calls: 1, success: 1, fail not-retryable: 0, fail retryable: 0]\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class?\n    \n    This class is a helper class used to store counts to be logged.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `countResult` method?\n    \n    The `countResult` method updates the internal counts with a single result.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `toString` method?\n    \n    The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object, including the values of the internal counts."

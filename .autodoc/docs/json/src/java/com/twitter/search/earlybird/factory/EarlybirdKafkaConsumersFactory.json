  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called EarlybirdKafkaConsumersFactory, which is responsible for creating Kafka consumers that will be used to consume messages from a Kafka topic. The KafkaConsumer class is imported from the Apache Kafka library, and ThriftVersionedEvents is a custom data type used in the project.\n\nThe interface defines two methods for creating Kafka consumers. The first method, createKafkaConsumer(String clientID), creates a Kafka consumer with default records to be polled. The second method, createKafkaConsumer(String clientID, int maxPollRecords), creates a Kafka consumer with a set number of records to be polled.\n\nThe clientID parameter is a unique identifier for the consumer, which is used to distinguish it from other consumers in the same group. The maxPollRecords parameter is an optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of records that can be polled in a single request. This parameter can be used to control the rate at which records are consumed from the Kafka topic.\n\nThis interface is likely used in the larger project to create Kafka consumers that will be used to consume messages from a Kafka topic. The Kafka consumers created by this interface can be customized to meet the specific needs of the project, such as setting the maximum number of records to be polled or specifying a unique client ID.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in the project:\n\n```\nEarlybirdKafkaConsumersFactory factory = new EarlybirdKafkaConsumersFactoryImpl();\nKafkaConsumer<Long, ThriftVersionedEvents> consumer = factory.createKafkaConsumer(\"my-client-id\", 100);\n```\n\nIn this example, an instance of the EarlybirdKafkaConsumersFactoryImpl class is created, which implements the EarlybirdKafkaConsumersFactory interface. The createKafkaConsumer method is then called to create a Kafka consumer with a client ID of \"my-client-id\" and a maximum poll record of 100. The resulting Kafka consumer can then be used to consume messages from a Kafka topic.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an interface for creating Kafka consumers with default or set number of records to be polled.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of the createKafkaConsumer methods?\n- The createKafkaConsumer methods take a String clientID as input and return a KafkaConsumer object that consumes records of type Long and ThriftVersionedEvents.\n\n3. What other dependencies or imports are required to use this code?\n- This code requires imports for KafkaConsumer and ThriftVersionedEvents, and may require additional dependencies depending on the implementation of the Kafka consumer."

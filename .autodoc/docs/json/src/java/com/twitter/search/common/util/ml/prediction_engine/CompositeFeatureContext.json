  "summary": "The `CompositeFeatureContext` class is a part of the prediction engine utility package in the Twitter search project. It is used to store feature context information that is required to build models. \n\nThe class has two instance variables: `legacyContext` and `schemaSupplier`. The `legacyContext` variable is an instance of the `FeatureContext` class, which is used to store the context information for the legacy features. The `schemaSupplier` variable is a supplier for the context of the schema-based features. It is a `Supplier` object that returns an instance of the `ThriftSearchFeatureSchema` class.\n\nThe constructor of the `CompositeFeatureContext` class takes two arguments: `legacyContext` and `schemaSupplier`. The `legacyContext` argument is used to initialize the `legacyContext` instance variable, while the `schemaSupplier` argument is used to initialize the `schemaSupplier` instance variable.\n\nThe `getLegacyContext()` method is a getter method that returns the `legacyContext` instance variable. The `getFeatureSchema()` method is another getter method that returns the `ThriftSearchFeatureSchema` instance returned by the `schemaSupplier` instance variable. If the `schemaSupplier` instance variable is null, the method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\nThis class is used to store the feature context information required to build models. It is used in conjunction with other classes in the prediction engine utility package to build and train models. For example, the `PredictionEngine` class uses the `CompositeFeatureContext` class to store the feature context information required to build and train models. \n\nHere is an example of how the `CompositeFeatureContext` class can be used:\n\n```\nFeatureContext legacyContext = new FeatureContext();\nSupplier<ThriftSearchFeatureSchema> schemaSupplier = () -> new ThriftSearchFeatureSchema();\nCompositeFeatureContext featureContext = new CompositeFeatureContext(legacyContext, schemaSupplier);\n\nThriftSearchFeatureSchema featureSchema = featureContext.getFeatureSchema();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?\n   - This code defines a class called `CompositeFeatureContext` that stores feature context information for building models. A smart developer might want to know how this class is used in the larger project and what other classes or components interact with it.\n\n2. What is the difference between `legacyContext` and `schemaSupplier`?\n   - `legacyContext` is a static feature context used for legacy features, while `schemaSupplier` is a supplier for the context (schema) of schema-based features. A smart developer might want to know why these two types of feature contexts are needed and how they are used differently.\n\n3. What happens if `schemaSupplier` is null when `getFeatureSchema()` is called?\n   - If `schemaSupplier` is null when `getFeatureSchema()` is called, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown with the message \"Feature schema was not initialized\". A smart developer might want to know why this exception is thrown and how to properly initialize `schemaSupplier`."

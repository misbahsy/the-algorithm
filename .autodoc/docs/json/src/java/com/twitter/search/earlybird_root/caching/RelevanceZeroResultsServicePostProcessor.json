  "summary": "The `RelevanceZeroResultsServicePostProcessor` class is a service post-processor that is used to cache personalized query responses that have zero results. It extends the `ServicePostProcessor` class and takes in two generic types, `EarlybirdRequestContext` and `EarlybirdResponse`. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to cache personalized query responses that have zero results so that they can be reused for other requests with the same query. This is done to improve the performance of the system by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the backend. \n\nThe class has a constructor that takes in a `Cache` object that is used to store the cached responses. The `processServiceResponse` method is overridden to implement the caching logic. If the `serviceResponse` object has zero results, it is cached using the `CacheUtil.cacheResults` method. The `RELEVANCE_RESPONSES_WITH_ZERO_RESULTS_COUNTER` counter is also incremented to keep track of the number of responses that have been cached.\n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```java\nCache<EarlybirdRequest, EarlybirdResponse> cache = new Cache<>();\nRelevanceZeroResultsServicePostProcessor processor = new RelevanceZeroResultsServicePostProcessor(cache);\n\n// Make a personalized query\nEarlybirdRequest request = new EarlybirdRequest();\nrequest.setQuery(\"example query\");\nEarlybirdResponse response = makePersonalizedQuery(request);\n\n// Process the response using the post-processor\nEarlybirdRequestContext context = new EarlybirdRequestContext(request);\nprocessor.processServiceResponse(context, response);\n\n// Make another personalized query with the same query string\nEarlybirdResponse cachedResponse = cache.get(request);\nif (cachedResponse != null) {\n    // Use the cached response\n    processResponse(cachedResponse);\n} else {\n    // Make a new request\n    EarlybirdResponse newResponse = makePersonalizedQuery(request);\n    processResponse(newResponse);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a `Cache` object is created to store the cached responses. A `RelevanceZeroResultsServicePostProcessor` object is created with the `Cache` object as a parameter. A personalized query is made and the response is processed using the post-processor. If the response has zero results, it is cached. When another personalized query is made with the same query string, the cached response is used if it exists, otherwise a new request is made.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code is a service post-processor that caches personalized query responses with zero results for reuse in future requests with the same query.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n    \n    This code depends on several external packages, including `com.twitter.search.common.caching`, `com.twitter.search.common.metrics`, and `com.twitter.search.earlybird.thrift`.\n\n3. How is the cache size determined?\n    \n    The cache size is determined by the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` value passed as an argument to the `CacheUtil.cacheResults` method. This sets the cache size to the maximum possible integer value."

  "summary": "The `TermQueryWithSafeToString` class is a workaround for an issue in the Lucene library where calling `toString` on a `TermQuery` object containing an `IntTerm` or a `LongTerm` may cause exceptions due to these types not being valid UTF-8. This class extends the `TermQuery` class and overrides its `toString` method to produce the same output as `TermQuery.toString` but with a safe string representation of the term value.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a safe way to obtain a string representation of a `TermQuery` object that contains an `IntTerm` or a `LongTerm`. This is important because `TermQuery` objects are used extensively in the search functionality of the Twitter platform, and it is necessary to be able to obtain a string representation of these objects for debugging and logging purposes.\n\nAn example usage of this class would be in a search query builder that constructs `TermQuery` objects based on user input. The resulting `TermQuery` objects can then be safely converted to strings using the `toString` method of `TermQueryWithSafeToString` and included in the search request to the Lucene index.\n\nOverall, the `TermQueryWithSafeToString` class provides a simple yet effective workaround for a known issue in the Lucene library and ensures that `TermQuery` objects can be safely converted to strings in the context of the Twitter search functionality.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class?\n    \n    This class is a workaround for an issue where IntTerms and LongTerms are not valid utf8, which can cause exceptions when calling toString on a TermQuery containing them. It produces the same output as TermQuery.toString.\n\n2. How does this class differ from the TermQuery class?\n    \n    This class extends the TermQuery class and overrides its toString method to produce the same output as TermQuery.toString, but with a workaround for the issue with IntTerms and LongTerms.\n\n3. What is the significance of the termValueForToString parameter in the constructor?\n    \n    The termValueForToString parameter is used to store the value of the term for use in the toString method. It is necessary because calling toString on a TermQuery containing an IntTerm or a LongTerm can cause exceptions, so this class provides a workaround by using the stored value instead."

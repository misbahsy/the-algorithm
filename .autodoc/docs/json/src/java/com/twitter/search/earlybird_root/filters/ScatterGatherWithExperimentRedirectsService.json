  "summary": "The `ScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService` class is a service that redirects requests to different scatter-gather services based on an experiment cluster. It extends the `Service` class and takes in two parameters in its constructor: a control scatter-gather service and a map of experiment scatter-gather services. \n\nThe `apply` method is overridden to handle incoming requests. If the request contains an experiment cluster to use, the method checks if the experiment scatter-gather services map contains the specified cluster. If it does, the method applies the request to the corresponding scatter-gather service. If it does not, the method logs an error and returns a client error response. If the request does not contain an experiment cluster to use, the method applies the request to the control scatter-gather service.\n\nThis class is likely used in a larger project that involves running experiments on different clusters. The control scatter-gather service is used as a fallback for requests that do not specify an experiment cluster, while the experiment scatter-gather services are used for requests that do specify a cluster. This allows for easy testing and comparison of different algorithms or configurations on different clusters. \n\nExample usage:\n```\n// create control scatter-gather service\nService<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> controlService = new ControlScatterGatherService();\n\n// create experiment scatter-gather services map\nMap<ExperimentCluster, ScatterGatherService<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse>> experimentServices = new HashMap<>();\nexperimentServices.put(ExperimentCluster.CLUSTER_A, new ExperimentScatterGatherServiceA());\nexperimentServices.put(ExperimentCluster.CLUSTER_B, new ExperimentScatterGatherServiceB());\n\n// create scatter-gather with experiment redirects service\nScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService service = new ScatterGatherWithExperimentRedirectsService(controlService, experimentServices);\n\n// apply request to service\nEarlybirdRequestContext request = new EarlybirdRequestContext(new EarlybirdRequest());\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> response = service.apply(request);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a service that redirects requests to different scatter-gather services based on an experiment cluster specified in the request.\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code depends on the `com.twitter.finagle` and `com.twitter.search` libraries, as well as the `org.slf4j` logging library.\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?\n   - The `apply` method takes an `EarlybirdRequestContext` object as input and returns a `Future` of an `EarlybirdResponse` object as output. The response object contains a response code and a debug string."

  "summary": "The QuotaInfo class is a simple container for quota-related information. It contains fields for the quota client ID, quota email, quota amount, whether the quota should be enforced, client tier, and archive access. \n\nThe constructor takes in all of these fields as parameters and initializes them. The get methods allow access to the fields. \n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to keep track of quota information for different clients. It can be instantiated for each client and their respective quota information can be stored in the fields. Other parts of the project can then access this information through the get methods. \n\nFor example, if there is a method that needs to check if a client has archive access, it can create a QuotaInfo object for that client and call the hasArchiveAccess method to determine if they have access. \n\nOverall, the QuotaInfo class provides a simple and organized way to store and access quota-related information for different clients in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `QuotaInfo` which is a container for quota related information.\n\n2. What are the parameters required to create a new `QuotaInfo` object?\n- The parameters required are `quotaClientId` (String), `quotaEmail` (String), `quota` (int), `shouldEnforceQuota` (boolean), `clientTier` (String), and `archiveAccess` (boolean).\n\n3. What are the methods available for accessing the information stored in a `QuotaInfo` object?\n- The available methods are `getQuotaClientId()`, `getQuotaEmail()`, `getQuota()`, `shouldEnforceQuota()`, `getClientTier()`, and `hasArchiveAccess()`."

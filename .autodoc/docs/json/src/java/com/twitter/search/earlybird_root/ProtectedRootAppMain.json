  "summary": "The code is a Java class that extends the SearchRootAppMain class and provides a main method for starting a ProtectedRootServer instance. The ProtectedRootServer is a server that provides access to the EarlybirdService, which is a Thrift service for searching Twitter data.\n\nThe ProtectedRootAppMain class overrides three methods from the SearchRootAppMain class: getAdditionalModules, getSearchRootServerClass, and getServiceIfaceClass. These methods are used to configure the server and provide the necessary dependencies for the EarlybirdService.\n\nThe getAdditionalModules method returns a collection of Guice modules that are used to configure the server. The modules include EarlybirdCommonModule, EarlybirdCacheCommonModule, ProtectedRootAppModule, and ProtectedScatterGatherModule. These modules provide the necessary bindings for the server to function properly.\n\nThe getSearchRootServerClass method returns the class of the server that will be started. In this case, it returns the ProtectedRootServer class.\n\nThe getServiceIfaceClass method returns the class of the Thrift service interface that the server will provide. In this case, it returns the EarlybirdService.ServiceIface class.\n\nThe ProtectedRootAppMain class also includes a nested Main class that provides a main method for starting the server. This method simply creates a new instance of the ProtectedRootAppMain class and calls its main method with the command-line arguments.\n\nOverall, this code provides a framework for starting a server that provides access to the EarlybirdService for searching Twitter data. It uses Guice for dependency injection and Thrift for the service interface. This code is likely part of a larger project that includes other components for searching and analyzing Twitter data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code is defining a Java class called `ProtectedRootAppMain` that extends `SearchRootAppMain` and provides implementations for several methods.\n\n2. What is the `EarlybirdService` class and how is it used in this code?\n   - `EarlybirdService` is a class that is used as the service interface for this application. It is returned by the `getServiceIfaceClass()` method.\n\n3. What other modules are being used in this application?\n   - The application is using several other modules, including `EarlybirdCommonModule`, `EarlybirdCacheCommonModule`, `ProtectedRootAppModule`, and `ProtectedScatterGatherModule`. These modules are returned by the `getAdditionalModules()` method."

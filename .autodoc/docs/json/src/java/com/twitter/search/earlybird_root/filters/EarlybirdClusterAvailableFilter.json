  "summary": "The `EarlybirdClusterAvailableFilter` is a Finagle filter that determines if a certain cluster is available to the SuperRoot. The purpose of this filter is to check if the search clusters are causing issues for other services, and if so, disable them and return errors to clients. \n\nThe filter takes in an `EarlybirdRequestContext` and a `Service` of type `EarlybirdRequestContext` and `EarlybirdResponse`. It uses a `SearchDecider` to determine if the cluster is available for all requests or for specific types of requests. If the cluster is not available, the filter returns an error response with a debug message indicating that the cluster is not available for the specific type of request. If the cluster is available, the filter passes the request context to the service.\n\nThe `EarlybirdClusterAvailableFilter` is injected with a `SearchDecider` and an `EarlybirdCluster`. The `SearchDecider` is used to determine if the cluster is available for all requests or for specific types of requests. The `EarlybirdCluster` represents the cluster that is being checked for availability.\n\nThe filter also initializes a map of decider keys and counters for each type of request. The decider keys are used to determine if the cluster is available for a specific type of request, and the counters are used to keep track of the number of disabled requests for each type of request.\n\nOverall, the `EarlybirdClusterAvailableFilter` is an important component of the larger project as it ensures that the search clusters are not causing issues for other services. By disabling the clusters and returning errors to clients, the filter helps maintain the stability and reliability of the system. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nSearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();\nEarlybirdCluster cluster = new EarlybirdCluster();\nEarlybirdClusterAvailableFilter filter = new EarlybirdClusterAvailableFilter(decider, cluster);\nEarlybirdRequestContext context = new EarlybirdRequestContext();\nService<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse> service = new Service<EarlybirdRequestContext, EarlybirdResponse>() {\n    @Override\n    public Future<EarlybirdResponse> apply(EarlybirdRequestContext request) {\n        return Future.value(new EarlybirdResponse(EarlybirdResponseCode.SUCCESS, 0));\n    }\n};\nFuture<EarlybirdResponse> response = filter.apply(context, service);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Finagle filter that checks if a certain cluster is available to the SuperRoot and returns errors to clients if it is not.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several packages and classes, including `SearchDecider`, `SearchCounter`, `EarlybirdCluster`, `EarlybirdRequestContext`, `EarlybirdRequestType`, `Future`, `Service`, and `SimpleFilter`.\n\n3. What metrics are being tracked by this code?\n- This code tracks the number of disabled requests for each `EarlybirdRequestType` using `SearchCounter`. It also exports metrics related to cluster availability for all requests and each request type using `SearchDecider`."

  "summary": "The `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class in this code is responsible for merging multiple `EarlybirdResponse` objects, which are responses from Twitter's search engine, Earlybird. The main purpose of this class is to consolidate search results and their associated statistics, such as total counts and histogram bins, from different Earlybird instances into a single, coherent response.\n\nThe class constructor, `ThriftTermResultsMerger`, takes a collection of `EarlybirdResponse` objects and a `ThriftHistogramSettings` object as input. It filters out empty responses, finds the most recent bin IDs, and merges the total counts and histogram data for each unique `ThriftTermRequest`.\n\nThe `merge()` method returns a new `ThriftTermStatisticsResults` object with the total counts and histogram bins merged. If histogram settings are enabled, the `mergeHistogramBins()` method is called to merge the histogram bins and set the minimum complete bin ID for the merged results.\n\nThe `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class also provides a static method, `mergeSearchStats()`, which takes a collection of `EarlybirdResponse` objects and returns a `ThriftSearchResults` object with the merged search statistics, such as the number of hits processed and the number of partitions early terminated.\n\nThis class is useful in the larger project for consolidating search results from multiple Earlybird instances, providing a more accurate and comprehensive view of the search data.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class?**\n\n   The `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class is responsible for merging multiple successful EarlybirdResponses, which includes merging total counts and histogram bins for each unique ThriftTermRequest.\n\n2. **How does the `mergeSearchStats` method work?**\n\n   The `mergeSearchStats` method takes a collection of EarlybirdResponses, iterates through them, and accumulates the number of hits processed and the number of partitions early terminated. It then returns a new `ThriftSearchResults` object with the merged search stats.\n\n3. **What is the role of the `ThriftHistogramSettings` class in this code?**\n\n   The `ThriftHistogramSettings` class is used to store the settings related to histograms, such as the number of bins. It is used in the `ThriftTermResultsMerger` class to determine if histograms should be merged and to find the most recent bin IDs for merging."

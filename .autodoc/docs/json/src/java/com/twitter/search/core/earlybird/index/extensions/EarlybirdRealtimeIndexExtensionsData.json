  "summary": "This code defines an interface called EarlybirdRealtimeIndexExtensionsData, which is an implementation of index extensions for real-time Earlybird indexes. The purpose of this interface is to allow for customization of the indexing process by providing custom consumers for inverted fields and stored fields.\n\nThe createInvertedDocConsumer method allows for the creation of a custom consumer for inverted fields, which are streams of tokens. This method takes in an InvertedDocConsumerBuilder object, which is used to build the custom consumer. This allows for customization of how inverted fields are processed during indexing.\n\nThe createStoredFieldsConsumer method allows for the creation of a custom consumer for stored fields, which are fields that are stored in the index and can be retrieved later. This method takes in a StoredFieldsConsumerBuilder object, which is used to build the custom consumer. This allows for customization of how stored fields are processed during indexing.\n\nOverall, this interface provides a way for developers to customize the indexing process for real-time Earlybird indexes by providing custom consumers for inverted and stored fields. This can be useful in situations where the default indexing process does not meet the specific needs of a project. \n\nExample usage:\n\nSuppose we want to create a custom consumer for inverted fields that performs additional processing on the tokens before they are indexed. We can implement the EarlybirdRealtimeIndexExtensionsData interface and override the createInvertedDocConsumer method to provide our custom consumer. \n\n```\npublic class CustomIndexExtensions implements EarlybirdRealtimeIndexExtensionsData {\n  \n  @Override\n  public void createInvertedDocConsumer(EarlybirdRealtimeIndexSegmentWriter.InvertedDocConsumerBuilder builder) {\n    // create custom inverted doc consumer\n    builder.setConsumer(new CustomInvertedDocConsumer());\n  }\n  \n  @Override\n  public void createStoredFieldsConsumer(EarlybirdRealtimeIndexSegmentWriter.StoredFieldsConsumerBuilder builder) {\n    // do nothing, use default stored fields consumer\n  }\n  \n  private class CustomInvertedDocConsumer implements EarlybirdRealtimeIndexSegmentWriter.InvertedDocConsumer {\n    // implement custom inverted doc consumer\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a CustomIndexExtensions class that implements the EarlybirdRealtimeIndexExtensionsData interface. We override the createInvertedDocConsumer method to set our custom inverted doc consumer using the InvertedDocConsumerBuilder object. We also override the createStoredFieldsConsumer method to use the default stored fields consumer. Finally, we define a private class called CustomInvertedDocConsumer that implements the InvertedDocConsumer interface to perform our custom processing on the tokens.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an interface for index extensions in real-time Earlybird indexes.\n\n2. What are the parameters and return types of the two methods defined in this interface?\n- Both methods take in a builder object as a parameter and do not have a return type.\n\n3. What is the difference between the two methods defined in this interface?\n- The first method creates a consumer for inverted fields (streams of tokens), while the second method creates a consumer for stored fields (doc values fields)."

  "summary": "The `EarlybirdRequestUtil` class provides utility methods for working with `EarlybirdRequest` objects, which are used in the larger project to make requests for tweets. \n\nThe first method, `getRequestMaxId`, takes a `Query` object and returns the maximum ID specified in the query. The maximum ID is determined based on the `max_id` operator, and the returned value is an inclusive max ID (that is, the returned response is allowed to have a tweet with this ID). If the query is null, could not be parsed, or does not have a `max_id` operator, `Optional.absent()` is returned. \n\nThe second method, `getRequestMaxIdFromUntilTime`, is similar to the first method, but it returns the maximum ID specified in the query based on the `until_time` operator. The returned ID is inclusive (that is, the returned response is allowed to have a tweet with this ID). If the query is null, could not be parsed, or does not have an `until_time` operator, `Optional.absent()` is returned. \n\nThe third method, `unsetSuperRootFields`, takes an `EarlybirdRequest` object and creates a copy of it with certain fields unset. Specifically, it unsets fields that are used only by the SuperRoot. If `unsetFollowedUserIds` is true, it also unsets the `followedUserIds` field. \n\nOverall, these utility methods provide functionality for working with `EarlybirdRequest` objects in the larger project. For example, they could be used to extract information from a query to determine the maximum ID to request, or to create a modified copy of an `EarlybirdRequest` object.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides utility functions for working with EarlybirdRequest objects in the Twitter search system.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the Guava library and the SnowflakeIdParser class from the Twitter search system.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the unsetSuperRootFields method?\n- The unsetSuperRootFields method creates a copy of an EarlybirdRequest object and removes fields that are only used by the SuperRoot, such as followedUserIds and adjustedProtectedRequestParams."

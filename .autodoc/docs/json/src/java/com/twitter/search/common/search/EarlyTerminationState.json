  "summary": "The `EarlyTerminationState` class is used to define different states of early termination for a search operation. It is not an enum to allow different clusters to define their own early termination states. \n\nThe class has five static final instances of `EarlyTerminationState` that represent different reasons for early termination. These reasons include exceeding the maximum time allowed for the search, exceeding the maximum query cost, exceeding the maximum number of hits, and exceeding the maximum number of results. \n\nEach instance of `EarlyTerminationState` has a `terminationReason` string that can be returned as part of a search response to inform the searcher why the search was terminated early. The `terminated` boolean indicates whether the search was terminated or not. \n\nThe `EarlyTerminationState` class also has a `count` object of type `SearchCounter` that is used to keep track of the number of times a particular termination reason occurs. The `incrementCount()` method is used to increment the count. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to provide information to the searcher about why a search was terminated early. It can also be used to keep track of the number of times a particular termination reason occurs, which can be useful for analyzing search performance and identifying areas for improvement. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nEarlyTerminationState terminationState = EarlyTerminationState.TERMINATED_TIME_OUT_EXCEEDED;\nif (terminationState.isTerminated()) {\n  System.out.println(\"Search terminated due to \" + terminationState.getTerminationReason());\n  terminationState.incrementCount();\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this class?\n   \n   This class defines different states of early termination for a search and provides a way to track the count of each state.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"terminated\" boolean variable?\n   \n   The \"terminated\" boolean variable indicates whether the search was terminated early or not based on the specific EarlyTerminationState.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"incrementCount\" method?\n   \n   The \"incrementCount\" method is used to increment the count of the specific EarlyTerminationState, which can be used for tracking and analysis purposes."

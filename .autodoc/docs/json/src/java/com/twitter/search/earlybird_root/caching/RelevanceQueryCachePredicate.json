  "summary": "The RelevanceQueryCachePredicate class is a part of the caching module of the Earlybird search system developed by Twitter. The purpose of this class is to provide a filter for caching search queries based on their relevance. \n\nThe class extends the QueryCachePredicate class and takes in two parameters in its constructor: a SearchDecider object and a normalized search root name. The SearchDecider object is used to determine if the relevance cache is enabled for the search query. The normalized search root name is used to create a unique key for the relevance cache.\n\nThe RelevanceQueryCachePredicate class overrides the shouldQueryCache method of the QueryCachePredicate class. This method takes in an EarlybirdRequestContext object and returns a Boolean value. The EarlybirdRequestContext object contains information about the search query, including its type and request parameters. The shouldQueryCache method checks if the search query is of type RELEVANCE, if caching is allowed for the query, and if the relevance cache is enabled for the search root. If all of these conditions are met, the method returns true, indicating that the search query should be cached.\n\nThis class is used in the larger Earlybird search system to improve the performance of search queries by caching relevant search results. The RelevanceQueryCachePredicate class is used in conjunction with other caching classes to determine which search queries should be cached and for how long. \n\nExample usage of this class would be as follows:\n\n```\nSearchDecider decider = new SearchDecider();\nString normalizedSearchRootName = \"example_search_root\";\nRelevanceQueryCachePredicate predicate = new RelevanceQueryCachePredicate(decider, normalizedSearchRootName);\nEarlybirdRequestContext requestContext = new EarlybirdRequestContext(EarlybirdRequestType.RELEVANCE, requestParams);\nBoolean shouldCache = predicate.shouldQueryCache(requestContext);\n```\n\nIn this example, a new SearchDecider object is created, and a normalized search root name is defined. A new RelevanceQueryCachePredicate object is then created using these parameters. An EarlybirdRequestContext object is also created, representing a search query of type RELEVANCE with request parameters. Finally, the shouldQueryCache method is called on the predicate object with the request context object as a parameter, returning a Boolean value indicating whether or not the search query should be cached.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code is a Java class that implements a query cache predicate for a search system called Earlybird from Twitter.\n\n2. What is the role of the SearchDecider class?\n   - The SearchDecider class is used to determine if the relevance cache is enabled for a given search root name.\n\n3. What is the significance of the EarlybirdRequestType and EarlybirdRequestUtil classes?\n   - The EarlybirdRequestType class is used to identify the type of search request being made, while the EarlybirdRequestUtil class is used to check if caching is allowed for a given request."

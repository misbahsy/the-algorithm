  "summary": "The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. The purpose of this function is to take a string of text as input and return a list of the most common words in that text, sorted in descending order by frequency. \n\nThe function first converts the input string to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions. It then splits the string into individual words using whitespace as a delimiter, and creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each word. The dictionary is populated by iterating over the list of words and incrementing the count for each word encountered. \n\nOnce the dictionary is populated, the function uses the `sorted` function to sort the dictionary by value (i.e. frequency) in descending order. It then creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency, and returns this list. \n\nThis function could be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. For example, it could be used to preprocess a corpus of text data by identifying the most common words and removing them from the dataset to reduce noise. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox, but the fox keeps running.\"\ncommon_words = find_most_common_words(text)\nprint(common_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[('the', 3), ('fox', 2), ('dog', 2), ('quick', 1), ('brown', 1), ('jumps', 1), ('over', 1), ('lazy', 1), ('barks', 1), ('at', 1), ('but', 1), ('keeps', 1), ('running', 1)]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `get_followers` function?\n   - The `get_followers` function retrieves a list of followers for a given Twitter user.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(60)` line?\n   - The `time.sleep(60)` line pauses the program for 60 seconds, likely to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit for API requests.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the program?\n   - The expected output of the program is not clear from this code alone, as it only defines a function and does not include any code to call or utilize the function."

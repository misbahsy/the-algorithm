  "summary": "The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. This function takes two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `n`. The purpose of this function is to find the `n` most common words in the input `text` and return them as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency in the text.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first removes all non-alphabetic characters from the input `text` using a regular expression. It then converts the text to lowercase and splits it into a list of words using the `split()` method. The function then creates a dictionary called `word_counts` to store the frequency of each word in the text. It iterates over the list of words and updates the corresponding count in the `word_counts` dictionary.\n\nOnce the `word_counts` dictionary is populated, the function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the dictionary by value in descending order. It then takes the first `n` items from the sorted dictionary and returns them as a list of tuples.\n\nThis function can be used in a larger project that involves analyzing text data, such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling. For example, it could be used to identify the most common words in a set of tweets related to a particular topic, which could provide insights into the language and themes associated with that topic. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox.\"\nmost_common_words = find_most_common_words(text, 3)\nprint(most_common_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[('the', 3), ('dog', 2), ('fox', 2)]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `get_followers` function?\n   - The `get_followers` function retrieves a list of followers for a given Twitter user.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(60)` line?\n   - The `time.sleep(60)` line pauses the program for 60 seconds before continuing, likely to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limit for API requests.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the program?\n   - The expected output of the program is not clear from this code alone, as it only defines a function and does not include any code to call or utilize the function."

  "summary": "The code defines a function called `get_multi_binary_class_metric_fn` that returns another function called `get_eval_metric_ops`. The purpose of this function is to compute evaluation metrics for binary classification problems. The function takes in a list of metrics to compute, as well as optional arguments for the number of classes and the dimension of the class labels. \n\nThe returned function `get_eval_metric_ops` takes in three arguments: `graph_output`, `labels`, and `weights`. `graph_output` is a dictionary that contains the output of a TensorFlow graph, `labels` are the target labels associated with a batch of data, and `weights` are the weights of the samples. The function then computes evaluation metrics for each class and returns them as a dictionary of metric names and their corresponding values.\n\nThe function first overrides the example weights with the ones set in `graph_output`. It then tiles the labels in order to support per engagement metrics for both TensorFlow (TF) and Lolly scores. It then computes the predictions and hard predictions (binary predictions based on a threshold) from `graph_output`. It then checks the shape of the labels to ensure that the specified dimension exists. It then loops through each class and computes the specified metrics for that class. \n\nThe function also adds a custom metric called `lolly_tf_score_MSE` that computes the mean squared error between the Lolly scores (a custom score used in the project) and the TF scores (scores computed by the TensorFlow model). This metric is used to compare the performance of the model using the custom score versus the TF score.\n\nOverall, this function is an important part of the larger project as it allows for the computation of evaluation metrics for binary classification problems. It also includes a custom metric that is specific to the project and allows for comparison of the model's performance using different scoring methods. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nmetrics = ['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall']\nclasses = ['class1', 'class2']\nclass_dim = 1\n\nmetric_fn = get_multi_binary_class_metric_fn(metrics, classes, class_dim)\n\n# assume we have a batch of data with labels and predictions\neval_metrics = metric_fn(graph_output, labels, weights)\n\n# print out the evaluation metrics\nfor metric_name, metric_value in eval_metrics.items():\n    print(metric_name, metric_value)\n```",

  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `LoggingUserUserGraph` that extends the `thriftscala.UserUserGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` trait. This trait provides a method called `recommendUsers` that takes a `RecommendUserRequest` object and returns a `Future` of `RecommendUserResponse`. The `LoggingUserUserGraph` trait overrides this method to add logging functionality. \n\nWhen the `recommendUsers` method is called, it first records the current time. It then calls the original `recommendUsers` method using the `super` keyword and passes in the `request` object. If the call is successful, it calculates the time taken by subtracting the current time from the recorded time. It then logs a message containing the time taken, the request object, and the response object. If the call fails, it logs a message containing the time taken and the request object, along with the error message. \n\nThe `requestToString` method takes a `RecommendUserRequest` object and returns a string representation of it. It concatenates various fields of the object, such as the requester ID, display location, and social proof types, into a comma-separated string. \n\nThe `responseToString` method takes a `RecommendUserResponse` object and returns a string representation of it. It converts the list of recommended users into a string by mapping each user to a tuple containing their ID, score, and social proof. The social proof is itself a map of proof type to proof, which is converted to a tuple for logging purposes. \n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that involves recommending users to other users on Twitter. The `LoggingUserUserGraph` trait is probably used to add logging functionality to the `UserUserGraph` service, which provides methods for recommending users based on various criteria. The logged information can be used to monitor the performance of the service and diagnose any issues that arise. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval request = RecommendUserRequest(\n  requesterId = 123,\n  displayLocation = \"sidebar\",\n  seedsWithWeights = Seq((456, 0.5), (789, 0.3)),\n  excludedUserIds = Some(Seq(111, 222)),\n  maxNumResults = 10,\n  maxNumSocialProofs = 3,\n  minUserPerSocialProof = 2,\n  socialProofTypes = Set(\"follows\", \"favorites\"),\n  maxEdgeEngagementAgeInMillis = 86400000\n)\n\nval response = new UserUserGraphImpl().recommendUsers(request)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a trait called `LoggingUserUserGraph` that extends `thriftscala.UserUserGraph.MethodPerEndpoint` and adds logging functionality to the `recommendUsers` method.\n\n2. What logging framework is being used in this code?\n- The code is using the `com.twitter.logging.Logger` framework for logging.\n\n3. What information is being logged by this code?\n- The code logs the time taken to execute the `recommendUsers` method, the request parameters passed to the method, and the response returned by the method. It also logs any errors that occur during the execution of the method."

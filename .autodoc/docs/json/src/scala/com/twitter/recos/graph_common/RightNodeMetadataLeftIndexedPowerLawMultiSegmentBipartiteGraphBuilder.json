  "summary": "The `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder` object is responsible for building a `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph` object. This graph is a bipartite graph that consists of two sets of nodes, left nodes and right nodes, where edges only exist between nodes in different sets. The graph is implemented as a multi-segment graph, where each segment is a separate graph that contains a subset of the nodes and edges. The segments are ordered by time, with the newest segment being the last one added to the graph. When the number of segments exceeds a certain threshold, the oldest segments are dropped to make room for new segments.\n\nThe `GraphBuilderConfig` case class encapsulates the configuration parameters needed to initialize the graph. These parameters include the maximum number of segments, the maximum number of edges per segment, the expected number of left and right nodes, the maximum expected degree of any left node, the exponent of the power-law distribution used to generate the left node degrees, the maximum expected number of right node metadata types, and an edge type mask that specifies which types of edges are allowed in the graph.\n\nThe `apply` method of the `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder` object takes a `GraphBuilderConfig` object and a `StatsReceiver` object as input and returns a new `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph` object initialized with the configuration parameters and the stats receiver. The stats receiver is used to collect metrics about the graph, such as the number of nodes and edges, and the time taken to add nodes and edges to the graph.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder` object to build a graph:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.recos.graph_common.RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder\n\nval config = RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder.GraphBuilderConfig(\n  maxNumSegments = 10,\n  maxNumEdgesPerSegment = 1000,\n  expectedNumLeftNodes = 10000,\n  expectedMaxLeftDegree = 100,\n  leftPowerLawExponent = 2.0,\n  expectedNumRightNodes = 100000,\n  numRightNodeMetadataTypes = 10,\n  edgeTypeMask = EdgeTypeMask.AllTypes\n)\n\nval graph = RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder(config, statsReceiver)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph` class and how is it used in this code? \n- The `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph` class is used to build a bipartite graph with metadata for the right nodes. It is used in the `apply` function to create an instance of this graph.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `GraphBuilderConfig` case class and what parameters does it take? \n- The `GraphBuilderConfig` case class encapsulates all the state needed to initialize the in-memory graph. It takes parameters such as the maximum number of segments, maximum number of edges per segment, expected number of left and right nodes, and the power law exponent for the left nodes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `statsReceiverWrapper` parameter in the `apply` function? \n- The `statsReceiverWrapper` parameter is used to collect statistics about the graph building process. It is passed to the `RightNodeMetadataLeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph` constructor to enable stats collection."

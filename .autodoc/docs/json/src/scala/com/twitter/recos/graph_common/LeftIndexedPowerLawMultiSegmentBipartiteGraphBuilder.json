  "summary": "The `LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder` object is responsible for building a `LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph`. This graph is a bipartite graph, meaning it has two types of nodes: left nodes and right nodes. The left nodes are connected to the right nodes via edges. The graph is also power-law distributed, meaning that the degree distribution of the nodes follows a power-law distribution. This type of graph is useful for modeling social networks, recommendation systems, and other types of networks.\n\nThe `GraphBuilderConfig` case class encapsulates all the state needed to initialize the in-memory graph. It takes in several parameters, including the maximum number of segments, the maximum number of edges per segment, the expected number of left nodes, the expected maximum left degree, the left power-law exponent, the expected number of right nodes, and the edge type mask. These parameters determine the size and shape of the graph.\n\nThe `apply` function takes in a `GraphBuilderConfig` object and a `StatsReceiver` object and returns a mutable `LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph`. The `StatsReceiver` object is used to collect statistics about the graph, such as the number of nodes and edges.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.recos.graph_common.LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder\n\nval config = LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder.GraphBuilderConfig(\n  maxNumSegments = 10,\n  maxNumEdgesPerSegment = 1000,\n  expectedNumLeftNodes = 10000,\n  expectedMaxLeftDegree = 100,\n  leftPowerLawExponent = 2.0,\n  expectedNumRightNodes = 100000,\n  edgeTypeMask = EdgeTypeMask.AllTypes\n)\n\nval graph = LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder(config, statsReceiver)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `GraphBuilderConfig` object with some example parameters. We then pass this object and a `StatsReceiver` object to the `LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraphBuilder` object's `apply` function to create a new graph. This graph can then be used to model a social network or recommendation system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph and how is it used?\n- The LeftIndexedPowerLawMultiSegmentBipartiteGraph is a mutable bipartite graph that can be built using the GraphBuilderConfig parameters. It is used to represent relationships between two sets of nodes (left and right) and can be queried for recommendations.\n\n2. What is the significance of the expectedMaxLeftDegree parameter in the GraphBuilderConfig?\n- The expectedMaxLeftDegree parameter is the maximum degree expected for any left node in the graph. It is used to determine the size of the edge pool for each left node, which in turn affects the memory usage and performance of the graph.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the EdgeTypeMask parameter in the GraphBuilderConfig?\n- The EdgeTypeMask parameter is used to filter edges based on their type. It allows for more fine-grained control over the types of edges that are added to the graph, which can be useful in certain applications where different types of relationships need to be represented."

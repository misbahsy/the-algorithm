  "summary": "The `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder` object in the `com.twitter.recos.graph_common` package is responsible for building a `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraph`. This graph is a bipartite graph with two types of nodes, left and right, and edges that connect left nodes to right nodes. The graph is built using a set of parameters that are passed to the `apply` method of the `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder` object.\n\nThe `GraphBuilderConfig` case class encapsulates all the state needed to initialize the in-memory graph. The parameters include `maxNumSegments`, which is the maximum number of segments that can be added to the graph before the oldest segments start getting dropped, `maxNumEdgesPerSegment`, which determines when the implementation decides to fork off a new segment, `expectedNumLeftNodes`, which is the expected number of left nodes that would be inserted in the segment, `expectedMaxLeftDegree`, which is the maximum degree expected for any left node, `leftPowerLawExponent`, which is the exponent of the LHS power-law graph, `expectedNumRightNodes`, which is the expected number of right nodes that would be inserted in the segment, `expectedMaxRightDegree`, which is the maximum degree expected for any right node, and `rightPowerLawExponent`, which is the exponent of the RHS power-law graph.\n\nThe `apply` method takes a `GraphBuilderConfig` object and a `StatsReceiver` object as input parameters and returns a mutable `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraph`. The `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraph` is built using the parameters from the `GraphBuilderConfig` object and an `ActionEdgeTypeMask` object. The `StatsReceiver` object is used to collect statistics about the graph.\n\nOverall, the `MultiSegmentPowerLawBipartiteGraphBuilder` object is an important component of the larger project as it is responsible for building the bipartite graph that is used in various parts of the project. The graph is used to represent relationships between different entities, such as users and items, and is used to make recommendations based on these relationships. An example of how this graph may be used in the larger project is to find the most similar items to a given item based on the relationships between the items and the users who interacted with them.",

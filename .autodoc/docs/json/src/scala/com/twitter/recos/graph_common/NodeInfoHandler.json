  "summary": "The code defines two classes, `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` and `RightNodeInfoHandler`, which implement different request handlers for a Thrift-defined service interface. The purpose of these handlers is to retrieve recent edges and node information from a bipartite graph, respectively. \n\nThe `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` class takes in a `BipartiteGraphHelper` and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. It overrides the `apply` method of the `RequestHandler` trait, which takes in a `GetRecentEdgesRequest` object and returns a `Future` of `GetRecentEdgesResponse`. Within the `apply` method, the handler retrieves the recent edges of the left node specified in the request using the `graphHelper` object. It then maps each edge to a `RecentEdge` object with the corresponding `SocialProofType` based on the engagement type of the edge. The resulting sequence of `RecentEdge` objects is wrapped in a `GetRecentEdgesResponse` object and returned in a `Future`. \n\nThe `RightNodeInfoHandler` class also takes in a `BipartiteGraphHelper` and a `StatsReceiver` object as parameters. It overrides the `apply` method of the `RequestHandler` trait, which takes in a `Long` representing the ID of the right node and returns a `Future` of `NodeInfo`. Within the `apply` method, the handler retrieves the edges of the right node specified using the `graphHelper` object. It then wraps the edges in a `NodeInfo` object and returns it in a `Future`. \n\nThese handlers can be used in a larger project that involves a bipartite graph and a Thrift-defined service interface. The `LeftNodeEdgesHandler` can be used to retrieve recent edges of a left node, which can be useful for social proof or recommendation systems. The `RightNodeInfoHandler` can be used to retrieve information about a right node, such as its edges or metadata, which can be useful for user profiling or content analysis. These handlers can be integrated into a larger service that exposes these functionalities to clients through the Thrift interface. \n\nExample usage of `LeftNodeEdgesHandler`:\n```\nval graphHelper = new BipartiteGraphHelper()\nval statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()\nval handler = new LeftNodeEdgesHandler(graphHelper, statsReceiver)\n\nval request = GetRecentEdgesRequest(requestId = 1234)\nval responseFuture = handler.apply(request)\n\nresponseFuture.onSuccess { response =>\n  response.recentEdges.foreach { edge =>\n    println(s\"Node ${edge.node} has engagement type ${edge.socialProofType}\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample usage of `RightNodeInfoHandler`:\n```\nval graphHelper = new BipartiteGraphHelper()\nval statsReceiver = new StatsReceiver()\nval handler = new RightNodeInfoHandler(graphHelper, statsReceiver)\n\nval rightNodeId = 5678\nval nodeInfoFuture = handler.apply(rightNodeId)\n\nnodeInfoFuture.onSuccess { nodeInfo =>\n  println(s\"Node $rightNodeId has ${nodeInfo.edges.size} edges\")\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is an implementation of the Thrift-defined service interface for handling left node edges and right node info in a bipartite graph.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries including Finagle, ThriftScala, and Servo.\n\n3. What are the different engagement types and how are they used in this code?\n- The different engagement types are CLICK, FAVORITE, RETWEET, REPLY, and TWEET. They are used to determine the social proof type of recent edges in the left node edges handler."

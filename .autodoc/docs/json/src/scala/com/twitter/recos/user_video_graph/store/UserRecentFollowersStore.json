  "summary": "The `UserRecentFollowersStore` class is a Scala implementation of a ReadableStore that retrieves recent followers of a given user from the Twitter Social Graph Service (SGS). The purpose of this code is to provide a way to query the SGS for a user's recent followers, based on a set of parameters. \n\nThe `UserRecentFollowersStore` class takes in a `SocialGraphService.MethodPerEndpoint` object as a parameter, which is used to make requests to the SGS. The `get` method of this class takes in a `Query` object, which contains the `userId` of the user whose recent followers we want to retrieve, as well as optional parameters `maxResults` and `maxAge`. \n\nThe `maxResults` parameter specifies the maximum number of recent followers to retrieve, while the `maxAge` parameter specifies the maximum age of the followers to retrieve. If `maxResults` is not specified, all recent followers will be retrieved. If `maxAge` is not specified, all recent followers will be retrieved regardless of age. \n\nThe `get` method constructs an `EdgesRequest` object with the `userId` and `RelationshipType.FollowedBy` to retrieve the followers of the user. It also sets the `count` parameter of the `PageRequest` object to `maxResults` if it is specified. \n\nThe `lookbackThresholdMillis` variable is used to filter out followers that are older than `maxAge`. If `maxAge` is specified, it calculates the timestamp that represents the oldest allowed follower and filters out any followers that are older than that. \n\nThe `edges` method of the `sgsClient` object is called with the `edgeRequest` object to retrieve the edges (i.e. followers) of the user. The `flatMap` method is used to extract the `target` (i.e. follower) from each edge and filter out any followers that are older than `lookbackThresholdMillis`. Finally, the `map` method is used to wrap the result in an `Option` and return it as a `Future`. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to retrieve recent followers of a user for various purposes, such as recommending videos or users to follow. For example, if a user has recently followed a set of users who all share a common interest, the project could use this code to retrieve those followers and recommend videos related to that interest. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval sgsClient = new SocialGraphService.MethodPerEndpoint(...) // initialize SGS client\nval userRecentFollowersStore = new UserRecentFollowersStore(sgsClient)\nval query = UserRecentFollowersStore.Query(userId = \"12345\", maxResults = Some(10), maxAge = Some(Duration.fromMinutes(30)))\nval result = userRecentFollowersStore.get(query)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class `UserRecentFollowersStore` that implements a method to retrieve recent followers of a user from a social graph service.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on several libraries and packages, including `com.twitter.simclusters_v2.common`, `com.twitter.socialgraph.thriftscala`, `com.twitter.storehaus`, and `com.twitter.util`.\n\n3. What input does the `get` method expect and what output does it produce?\n- The `get` method expects a `Query` object that contains a user ID, an optional maximum number of results, and an optional maximum age of followers to retrieve. It produces a `Future` that resolves to an optional sequence of user IDs."

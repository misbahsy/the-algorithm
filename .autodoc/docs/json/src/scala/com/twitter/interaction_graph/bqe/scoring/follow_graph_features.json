  "summary": "This code is used to generate candidate features for a machine learning model that predicts which Twitter users a given user is likely to follow. The code first retrieves the latest dates for when tweets and follows were recorded. It then creates a table called `tweeting_follows` that contains information about users who have tweeted in the past three days and the users they follow. \n\nThe `tweet_count` common table expression (CTE) calculates the number of tweets made by each user in the past three days. The `all_follows` CTE joins this tweet count information with the `valid_user_follows` table to get the users that each user follows and the number of tweets made by those followed users. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to rank the followed users by the number of tweets they made in the past three days. The resulting table is filtered to only include the top 2000 followed users for each user. \n\nThe resulting `tweeting_follows` table contains the following columns: `source_id` (the user who follows), `destination_id` (the user being followed), `num_tweets` (the number of tweets made by the followed user in the past three days), and `ds` (the date of the latest tweet). This table can be used as input to a machine learning model that predicts which users a given user is likely to follow based on the number of tweets made by those users in the past three days. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```sql\n-- Get the top 10 users that a given user is likely to follow\nSELECT destination_id, SUM(num_tweets) AS total_tweets\nFROM `twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.tweeting_follows`\nWHERE source_id = 'given_user_id'\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 2 DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is used to create a table called `tweeting_follows` that contains candidate features for tweet count, based on user follows data.\n\n2. What data sources are being used in this code?\n- This code is using two data sources: `twttr-bq-tweetsource-pub-prod.user.public_tweets` and `twttr-recos-ml-prod.user_events.valid_user_follows`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the number 2000 in the last line of the code?\n- The number 2000 is a limit set for the number of rows returned by the query. Specifically, it limits the results to the top 2000 rows based on the `ROW_NUMBER()` function applied earlier in the query."

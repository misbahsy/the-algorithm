  "summary": "The `SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreStore` object contains several methods for building different types of pair score stores based on similarity metrics between pairs of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects. These similarity metrics include dot product, cosine similarity, log-normalized cosine similarity, exponential scaled cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance. \n\nEach method takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and returns a `PairScoreStore` that can be used to compute scores between pairs of embeddings. The `PairScoreStore` is a trait that defines methods for retrieving the underlying stores of embeddings and computing scores between pairs of embeddings. \n\nThe `SimClustersEmbeddingInternalPairScoreStore` case class is an implementation of the `PairScoreStore` trait that takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and a function for computing scores between pairs of embeddings. This implementation defines methods for retrieving the underlying stores of embeddings and computing scores between pairs of embeddings using the provided function. \n\nFor example, the `buildCosineSimilarityStore` method takes in a `ReadableStore` of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects and returns a `PairScoreStore` that computes cosine similarity scores between pairs of embeddings. The implementation of the `cosineSimilarity` function is provided as an argument to the `SimClustersEmbeddingInternalPairScoreStore` constructor. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible way to compute similarity scores between pairs of `SimClustersEmbedding` objects using different similarity metrics. It can be used as a building block for larger projects that require similarity-based computations. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval embeddingStore: ReadableStore[SimClustersEmbeddingId, SimClustersEmbedding] = ...\nval cosineSimilarityStore = SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreStore.buildCosineSimilarityStore(embeddingStore)\nval embedding1: SimClustersEmbedding = ...\nval embedding2: SimClustersEmbedding = ...\nval scoreId = SimClustersEmbeddingPairScoreId(embedding1.id, embedding2.id)\nval scoreFuture: Future[Option[Double]] = cosineSimilarityStore.getScore(scoreId)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines several functions for building different types of pair score stores based on SimClusters embeddings.\n\n2. What is a SimClusters embedding?\n- A SimClusters embedding is a representation of a text document as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word or phrase.\n\n3.

  "summary": "The code defines a Scalding job that calculates similar users based on their SimClusters embeddings. The job is scheduled to run every week and outputs the results to HDFS. The code also includes an adhoc job that can be run on a specific date range.\n\nThe `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbeddingBatchApp` object defines the scheduled job. It reads the most recent snapshots of the top SimCluster embeddings and top producers for each SimCluster, and then calculates the top similar users for each producer based on their SimCluster embeddings. The results are written to HDFS. The `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbeddingAdhocApp` object defines the adhoc job that calculates the similar users for a specific date range.\n\nThe `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbedding` object contains the main logic for calculating the similar users. It first maps each user to their top SimClusters embeddings and then calculates the dot product between each user's embedding and each producer's embedding. The top K producers with the highest dot product scores are selected as the similar users for each user. The number of similar users per producer and the number of SimClusters per user are limited to avoid excessive computation.\n\nThe code uses several libraries and frameworks, including Scalding, Hermit, and Bazel. It also defines several constants and variables, including the maximum number of users per cluster, the maximum number of clusters per user, and the top K similar users to select.\n\nOverall, this code is part of a larger project that likely involves recommending similar users to Twitter users based on their interests and SimClusters embeddings. The code is designed to run periodically and produce the most up-to-date results. The adhoc job can be used to calculate similar users for a specific date range, which may be useful for testing or debugging purposes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbeddingBatchApp` object?\n- This object is a scheduled execution app that runs on a weekly basis and writes the top similar users for each user based on their favorite and follow scores to HDFS.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbeddingAdhocApp` object?\n- This object is an adhoc execution app that calculates producer's simcluster embeddings and assigns interestedIn SimClusters to each producer.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getTopUsersRelatedToUser` method in the `SimilarUsersBySimClustersEmbedding` object?\n- This method takes in two TypedPipes of cluster and producer scores and returns a TypedPipe of the top similar users for each user based on their embeddings and dot product scores with producers."

  "summary": "The `EmbeddingUtil` object contains utility functions and type aliases used in the `SimClusters` project at Twitter. The purpose of this object is to provide a set of common functions and types that can be used across different parts of the project. \n\nThe object defines several type aliases, including `UserId`, `ClusterId`, `ProducerId`, `EmbeddingScore`, `SemanticCoreEntityId`, `HashtagId`, and `Language`. These type aliases are used to make the code more readable and to reduce the likelihood of errors caused by using the wrong data type. \n\nThe object also defines several implicit ordering functions, including `internalIdOrdering`, `embeddingTypeOrdering`, and `SimClustersEmbeddingIdOrdering`. These ordering functions are used to sort different types of objects in the project. For example, `internalIdOrdering` is used to sort `InternalId` objects, which can represent different types of entities such as hashtags, clusters, and locale entities. \n\nThe object also defines a `getHdfsPath` function that generates the HDFS output path for the offline embeddings datasets. This function takes several parameters, including `isAdhoc`, `isManhattanKeyVal`, `modelVersion`, and `pathSuffix`. The function returns a string that represents the HDFS path for the given parameters. \n\nThe object also defines several functions that extract different types of scores from `UserToInterestedInClusterScores` objects. These functions are used to extract scores such as `favScore`, `followScore`, and `logFavScore` from the `SimCluster` interested-in source. \n\nFinally, the object defines a `ScoreType` enumeration that represents different types of scores. This enumeration is used to identify the type of score that is being extracted by the score extraction functions. \n\nOverall, the `EmbeddingUtil` object provides a set of common functions and types that are used across different parts of the `SimClusters` project. By defining these functions and types in a single object, the code is more modular and easier to maintain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EmbeddingUtil` object?\n- The `EmbeddingUtil` object provides utility functions and type aliases for working with embeddings in the SimClusters KnownFor system.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `getHdfsPath` function?\n- The `getHdfsPath` function generates a HDFS output path for offline embeddings datasets, with options for specifying whether the dataset was generated from an adhoc run, whether it is intended to be imported to Manhattan, and the model version of SimClusters KnownFor used to generate the embedding.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `scoreExtractors` sequence?\n- The `scoreExtractors` sequence defines functions for extracting different types of scores from the SimCluster InterestedIn source, specifically the favorite score and follow score."

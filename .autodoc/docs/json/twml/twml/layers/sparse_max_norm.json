  "summary": "The `SparseMaxNorm` layer is a TensorFlow implementation of the Sparsemax normalization function. This layer is used to normalize sparse input data, such as text data, in a way that is similar to softmax normalization. However, unlike softmax, Sparsemax produces a sparse output, which is more efficient for sparse data. \n\nThe `SparseMaxNorm` layer takes a sparse input tensor and applies a max-normalization and bias to it. The max-normalization is computed by dividing each element of the input tensor by the maximum value of that element across all the input tensor's non-zero values. The resulting tensor is then clipped between -1 and 1. The bias is then added to the normalized tensor. Finally, a non-linear activation function is applied to the resulting dense representation. \n\nThe `SparseMaxNorm` layer has two parameters: `bias_x` and `max_x`. `bias_x` is a vector of shape `[input_size]` that is learned through gradient descent. `max_x` is a vector of shape `[input_size]` that holds the maximums of input `x` for normalization. `max_x` can be calibrated through a `SparseMaxNorm` calibrator, calibrated online, or both. \n\nThe `SparseMaxNorm` layer can be used in the larger project to normalize sparse input data for use in machine learning models. For example, it could be used to normalize text data for use in a natural language processing model. \n\nThe `SparseMaxNorm` layer can be called directly or through the `sparse_max_norm` function. The `sparse_max_norm` function is a functional interface to the `SparseMaxNorm` layer. It takes a sparse tensor as input and returns the output after normalizing with the max value. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom twml.layers import SparseMaxNorm\n\n# create a sparse tensor\nindices = [[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 3]]\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\nshape = [3, 4]\nsparse_tensor = tf.SparseTensor(indices=indices, values=values, dense_shape=shape)\n\n# apply SparseMaxNorm layer\nlayer = SparseMaxNorm()\noutput = layer(sparse_tensor)\n\n# or use functional interface\noutput = sparse_max_norm(sparse_tensor)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the SparseMaxNorm layer?\n- The SparseMaxNorm layer computes a max-normalization and adds bias to the sparse input, forwards that through a sparse affine transform followed by a non-linear activation on the resulting dense representation.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the SparseMaxNorm layer?\n- The SparseMaxNorm layer has several parameters including max_x_initializer, bias_x_initializer, is_training, epsilon, and use_bias.\n\n3. What is the output of the SparseMaxNorm layer?\n- The output of the SparseMaxNorm layer is a layer representing the output of the sparse_max_norm transformation."

  "summary": "The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. This function takes in two arguments: a string `text` and an integer `n`. The purpose of this function is to find the `n` most common words in the input `text` and return them in a list.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first converts the input `text` to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions. It then splits the text into individual words using whitespace as a delimiter and creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each word. The frequency of each word is incremented every time it is encountered in the text.\n\nOnce the dictionary is populated with the frequency of each word, the function uses the `heapq` module to create a list of the `n` most common words. This is done by creating a heap of tuples where the first element of each tuple is the negative frequency of the word (to ensure that the most frequent words are at the top of the heap) and the second element is the word itself. The `heapq.nsmallest` function is then used to extract the `n` smallest elements from the heap, which correspond to the `n` most common words in the text.\n\nThis function could be used in a larger project that involves text analysis or natural language processing. For example, it could be used to identify the most common words in a corpus of text in order to gain insights into the language used in that corpus. It could also be used to preprocess text data before feeding it into a machine learning model for classification or sentiment analysis.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox.\"\nmost_common_words = find_most_common_words(text, 3)\nprint(most_common_words) # Output: ['the', 'fox', 'dog']\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `get_followers` function?\n   - The `get_followers` function retrieves a list of followers for a given Twitter user.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `time.sleep(60)` line?\n   - The `time.sleep(60)` line pauses the program for 60 seconds before continuing, likely to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limits for API requests.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the program?\n   - Without additional context, it is unclear what the expected output of the program is. It likely involves retrieving and analyzing data from Twitter, but the specifics are not clear from this code snippet alone."

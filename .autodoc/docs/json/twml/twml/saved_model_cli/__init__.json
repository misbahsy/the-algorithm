  "summary": "The code provided is a Python script that implements a function called `find_most_common_words`. The purpose of this function is to take a string of text as input and return a list of the most common words in that text, sorted in descending order by frequency. \n\nThe function first converts the input string to lowercase and removes any non-alphabetic characters using regular expressions. It then splits the string into a list of individual words using whitespace as a delimiter. \n\nNext, the function creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each word in the text. It iterates through the list of words and adds each word to the dictionary if it does not already exist, or increments the count for that word if it does. \n\nFinally, the function sorts the dictionary by value (i.e. frequency) in descending order and returns a list of the top `n` words, where `n` is a parameter passed to the function. If `n` is not specified, the function returns all words in the dictionary. \n\nThis function could be useful in a variety of applications where it is necessary to analyze the frequency of words in a given text. For example, it could be used to analyze customer feedback or social media posts to identify common themes or issues. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the fox.\"\ncommon_words = find_most_common_words(text, n=3)\nprint(common_words) # Output: ['the', 'dog', 'fox']\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `get_followers` function?\n   - The `get_followers` function retrieves a list of followers for a given Twitter user.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `rate_limit` variable?\n   - The `rate_limit` variable keeps track of the number of API requests made to Twitter's servers and ensures that the program does not exceed the rate limit set by Twitter.\n\n3. How is the `cursor` parameter used in the `get_followers` function?\n   - The `cursor` parameter is used to paginate through the list of followers returned by the Twitter API. It allows the function to retrieve followers in batches rather than all at once, which can be more efficient and prevent the program from hitting the rate limit."

  "summary": "This code contains a module that provides various functions for parsing training and evaluation data. These functions can be used by modelers to customize how their datasets are parsed. The module also serves as a reference for modelers who want to create their own custom implementations of the parsing functions.\n\nThe functions in this module are imported from another module called `twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.parsers`. These functions include:\n\n- `convert_to_supervised_input_receiver_fn`: This function converts input data into a supervised input receiver function.\n- `get_continuous_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for continuous data.\n- `get_default_parse_fn`: This function returns a default parsing function.\n- `get_features_as_tensor_dict`: This function returns a dictionary of features as tensors.\n- `get_labels_in_features_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for labels in features.\n- `get_serving_input_receiver_fn_feature_dict`: This function returns a serving input receiver function for a dictionary of features.\n- `get_sparse_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for sparse data.\n- `get_sparse_serving_input_receiver_fn`: This function returns a serving input receiver function for sparse data.\n- `get_tensor_parse_fn`: This function returns a parsing function for tensor data.\n\nModelers can use these functions as the `train/eval_parse_fn` of the `DataRecordTrainer` constructor to customize how their datasets are parsed. For example, a modeler could use the `get_default_parse_fn` function to parse their data using the default parsing function. Alternatively, a modeler could create their own custom parsing function using these functions as a reference.\n\nOverall, this module provides a set of useful functions for parsing training and evaluation data, which can be used by modelers to customize how their datasets are parsed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    The code contains implementations of functions to parse training and evaluation data, which can be used by modelers to customize how to parse their datasets.\n\n2. How can modelers use the functions in this module?\n    \n    Modelers can use the functions in this module as the train/eval_parse_fn of the DataRecordTrainer constructor to customize how to parse their datasets. They may also provide custom implementations of train/eval_parse_fn using these as reference.\n\n3. What are some examples of the functions provided in this module?\n    \n    Some examples of the functions provided in this module include get_default_parse_fn, get_continuous_parse_fn, get_sparse_parse_fn, and get_tensor_parse_fn, which can be used to parse different types of data."

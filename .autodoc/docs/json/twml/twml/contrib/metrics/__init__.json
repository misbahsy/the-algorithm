  "summary": "The code in this file is a module that contains experimental metrics for search and ranking. It imports two functions from other modules: `get_search_metric_fn` and `ndcg` from `search_metrics`, and all functions from `metrics`. \n\nThe purpose of this module is to provide additional metrics for evaluating the performance of search and ranking algorithms. These metrics can be used to compare different algorithms and to optimize their parameters. \n\nFor example, the `ndcg` function calculates the normalized discounted cumulative gain, which is a measure of the quality of a ranked list of items. It takes two arguments: `y_true` and `y_pred`, which are the true relevance scores and the predicted relevance scores, respectively. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```\nfrom search_metrics import ndcg\n\ny_true = [3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2]\ny_pred = [2.5, 0.0, 2, 1, 0, 0.5]\n\nndcg_score = ndcg(y_true, y_pred)\nprint(ndcg_score)\n```\n\nThis will output the ndcg score for the given lists, which is a value between 0 and 1. \n\nOverall, this module provides a useful set of metrics for evaluating search and ranking algorithms, which can be used to improve their performance and relevance.",
  "questions": "1. What specific metrics are included in this module?\n- The module includes experimental metrics for search and ranking, as well as search metrics and ndcg from the search_metrics module, and all metrics from the metrics module.\n\n2. Why is the wildcard-import disabled with pylint?\n- The wildcard-import is disabled with pylint to prevent importing unused modules and to ensure that all imported modules are explicitly listed.\n\n3. What is the purpose of this module in The Algorithm from Twitter project?\n- The purpose of this module is to provide experimental metrics for search and ranking, which may be used in the search and ranking algorithms of The Algorithm from Twitter project."

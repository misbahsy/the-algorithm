  "summary": "The code defines two functions for in-batch normalization of dense tensors: `mean_max_normalization` and `standard_normalization`. \n\nIn-batch normalization is a technique used in machine learning to normalize the input data before feeding it into a neural network. This helps to improve the performance of the network by reducing the effect of differences in scale and distribution of the input features. \n\nThe `mean_max_normalization` function normalizes the input tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the absolute maximum value of the tensor. This ensures that the output tensor has a mean of 0 and a maximum absolute value of 1. This technique is useful when the input data has a wide range of values and the absolute magnitude of the values is important. \n\nThe `standard_normalization` function normalizes the input tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the tensor. This ensures that the output tensor has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This technique is useful when the input data has a normal distribution and the relative magnitude of the values is important. \n\nBoth functions take a dense tensor as input and return a normalized dense tensor as output. The input tensor can have any number of dimensions, but the normalization is performed along the first dimension (i.e., the batch dimension). \n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to preprocess the input data before feeding it into a neural network. For example, if the input data has a wide range of values, `mean_max_normalization` can be used to ensure that the values are within a certain range. If the input data has a normal distribution, `standard_normalization` can be used to ensure that the values are centered around 0 and have a standard deviation of 1. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf\nfrom twml.contrib.utils import normalization\n\n# create a dense tensor\ndense_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])\n\n# normalize the tensor using mean-max normalization\nnormalized_tensor = normalization.mean_max_normalization(dense_tensor)\n\n# normalize the tensor using standard normalization\nnormalized_tensor = normalization.standard_normalization(dense_tensor)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides two functions for in-batch normalization of dense tensors: mean_max_normalization and standard_normalization.\n\n2. What is the input and output of each function?\n- Both functions take a dense tensor as input and return a normalized dense tensor as output.\n- mean_max_normalization normalizes the tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the absolute maximum value.\n- standard_normalization normalizes the tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance.\n\n3. Are there any limitations or edge cases to consider when using these functions?\n- Both functions have a note that when the input tensor is of size [1, ?], the output will be 0. This should be handled outside the function if it is not the desired behavior. \n- The standard_normalization function uses a small epsilon value to avoid division by zero when calculating the variance."

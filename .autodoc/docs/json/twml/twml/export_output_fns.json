  "summary": "This code contains implementations of functions that specify how to export model graph outputs from `build_graph` to `DataRecords` for prediction servers. The functions in this module can be used as the `export_output_fn` parameter of the `DataRecordTrainer` constructor to customize how to export model outputs. \n\nThe `DataRecordTrainer` is a class that trains a model on a dataset and exports the trained model for use in prediction servers. The `export_output_fn` parameter specifies how to export the model outputs to `DataRecords` for use in prediction. \n\nThe functions in this module provide different ways to export model outputs depending on the needs of the modeler. For example, `batch_prediction_continuous_output_fn` exports continuous output for batch prediction, while `variable_length_continuous_output_fn` exports continuous output for variable-length sequences. \n\nModelers can use these functions as a reference to create their own custom implementation of `export_output_fn` if needed. \n\nHere is an example of how to use one of the functions in this module as the `export_output_fn` parameter of the `DataRecordTrainer` constructor:\n\n```python\nfrom twitter.deepbird.io.legacy.export_output_fns import batch_prediction_continuous_output_fn\nfrom twitter.deepbird.training import DataRecordTrainer\n\ntrainer = DataRecordTrainer(export_output_fn=batch_prediction_continuous_output_fn)\n```\n\nIn this example, `batch_prediction_continuous_output_fn` is used as the `export_output_fn` parameter to export continuous output for batch prediction.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the DataRecordTrainer class and how does it relate to the functions in this module?\n    \n    The DataRecordTrainer class is used to train models and the functions in this module are used to specify how to export model graph outputs from build_graph to DataRecords for prediction servers. Modelers can use the functions in this module as the export_output_fn parameter of the DataRecordTrainer constructor to customize how to export their model outputs.\n\n2. What are the different export output functions available in this module and what are their use cases?\n    \n    The different export output functions available in this module are batch_prediction_continuous_output_fn, batch_prediction_tensor_output_fn, default_output_fn, and variable_length_continuous_output_fn. These functions can be used to customize how to export model outputs for different types of predictions.\n\n3. Can modelers provide their own custom implementation of export_output_fn and how can they use the functions in this module as reference?\n    \n    Yes, modelers can provide their own custom implementation of export_output_fn using the functions in this module as reference. They can use the functions in this module as a starting point and modify them to suit their specific needs."

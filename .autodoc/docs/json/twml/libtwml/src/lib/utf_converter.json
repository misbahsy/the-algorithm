  "summary": "The code provided is a C++ function that converts a UTF-8 encoded string to a UTF-16 encoded string. The function takes in a pointer to an array of 8-bit unsigned integers (uint8_t) representing the UTF-8 encoded string, the length of the input string, a pointer to an array of 16-bit unsigned integers (uint16_t) representing the output UTF-16 encoded string, and the maximum length of the output string. The function returns the length of the output string or -1 if there was an error during the conversion.\n\nThe function works by iterating through each byte of the input string and determining the corresponding Unicode code point. The code point is then converted to its UTF-16 representation and added to the output string. If the code point is outside the range of valid Unicode code points, the function returns -1 to indicate an error.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to handle text input and output in different languages and character sets. It allows the project to handle UTF-8 encoded text input and output, which is a widely used character encoding for text on the web. The function can be called by other parts of the project that need to convert between different character encodings. For example, if the project needs to display text in a user interface that only supports UTF-16 encoding, this function can be used to convert the input text to the correct encoding. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"internal/utf_converter.h\"\n\nint main() {\n  uint8_t utf8_string[] = u8\"Hello, world! üåç\";\n  uint16_t utf16_string[20];\n  ssize_t result = utf8_to_utf16(utf8_string, sizeof(utf8_string), utf16_string, 20);\n  if (result == -1) {\n    std::cout << \"Error converting string\" << std::endl;\n  } else {\n    std::wcout << utf16_string << std::endl;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a UTF-8 encoded string \"Hello, world! üåç\" is converted to a UTF-16 encoded string using the `utf8_to_utf16` function. The resulting UTF-16 string is then printed to the console. If there was an error during the conversion, an error message is printed instead.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a function that converts UTF-8 encoded text to UTF-16 encoded text.\n\n2. What is the expected input format for this function?\n- The function takes in a pointer to an array of uint8_t (8-bit unsigned integers) representing the UTF-8 encoded text, the length of the input array, a pointer to an array of uint16_t (16-bit unsigned integers) to store the UTF-16 encoded text, and the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the output array.\n\n3. What are the possible return values of this function?\n- The function returns the number of elements written to the output array if successful, or -1 if there was an error. Possible errors include invalid input, insufficient space in the output array, or encountering an invalid UTF-16 code point."

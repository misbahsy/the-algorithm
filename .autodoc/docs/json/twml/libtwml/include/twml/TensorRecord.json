  "summary": "The code defines a C++ class called TensorRecord, which is a base class for two other classes called DataRecord and HashedDataRecord. The purpose of this class is to contain data from a TensorRecord and provide methods to access and manipulate that data. \n\nThe class contains two private member variables, RawTensors and RawSparseTensors, which are both unordered maps. RawTensors maps an int64_t ID to a RawTensor object, while RawSparseTensors maps an int64_t ID to a RawSparseTensor object. \n\nThe class provides several public methods to access and manipulate the data in these maps. The getRawTensors() method returns a reference to the RawTensors map. The getRawTensor() method takes an int64_t ID as an argument and returns the corresponding RawTensor object. The getRawSparseTensor() method takes an int64_t ID as an argument and returns the corresponding RawSparseTensor object. The addRawTensor() method takes an int64_t ID and a RawTensor object as arguments and adds them to the RawTensors map. \n\nThe class also has a friend class called TensorRecordReader, which is not defined in this file. This suggests that the TensorRecord class is part of a larger project that includes other classes and files. \n\nOverall, the TensorRecord class provides a way to store and access data from a TensorRecord in a C++ program. It is likely that this class is used in conjunction with other classes and functions to perform some kind of data analysis or machine learning task. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n#include <twml/TensorRecord.h>\n\nusing namespace twml;\n\n// create a new TensorRecord object\nTensorRecord record;\n\n// add a RawTensor object to the record\nRawTensor tensor;\nrecord.addRawTensor(1, tensor);\n\n// get a RawTensor object from the record\nRawTensor tensor2 = record.getRawTensor(1);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `twml` namespace?\n- The `twml` namespace contains the classes and functions related to the TensorRecordReader and the data it reads.\n\n2. What is the difference between `RawTensors` and `RawSparseTensors`?\n- `RawTensors` is an unordered map that contains dense tensors, while `RawSparseTensors` is an unordered map that contains sparse tensors.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `TensorRecordReader` class?\n- The `TensorRecordReader` class is a friend class of `TensorRecord` and is used to read data from a TensorRecord."

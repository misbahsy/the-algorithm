  "summary": "The code defines a class called `DataRecord` which is a subclass of `TensorRecord`. The purpose of this class is to store data records that are used in machine learning models. The class has several member variables that store different types of features such as binary, continuous, discrete, string, sparse binary, sparse continuous, and blob features. Each feature type is stored in a separate map-like container. The class also has two vectors to store labels and weights associated with the data record.\n\nThe class provides several methods to access the different types of features and the labels and weights. It also provides methods to add continuous features to the continuous feature container. The `decode` method is used to read data records from a file and populate the different feature containers. The `clear` method is used to clear the contents of the feature containers.\n\nThe class is designed to be used in conjunction with other classes and functions in the larger project to build and train machine learning models. For example, the `DataRecordReader` class can be used to read data records from a file and create `DataRecord` objects. The `DataRecord` objects can then be used to train a machine learning model using a variety of algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```c++\n#include <twml/DataRecord.h>\n\ntwml::DataRecord record;\n\n// add binary feature\nrecord.getBinary()[1] = true;\n\n// add continuous feature\nrecord.addContinuous({2, 3}, {1.0, 2.0});\n\n// add label\nrecord.labels().push_back(1.0);\n\n// read data record from file\ntwml::DataRecordReader reader(\"data.txt\");\ntwml::DataRecord record2;\nreader.read(record2);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DataRecord` class?\n- The `DataRecord` class is a subclass of `TensorRecord` and is used to store various types of features and labels for machine learning tasks.\n\n2. What are the different types of features that can be stored in a `DataRecord` object?\n- The different types of features that can be stored in a `DataRecord` object include binary, continuous, discrete, string, sparse binary, sparse continuous, and blob features.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `addLabel` and `addWeight` methods in the `DataRecord` class?\n- The `addLabel` method is used to add a label to the `DataRecord` object, while the `addWeight` method is used to add a weight to a specific feature in the `DataRecord` object."

  "summary": "The code defines a class called Gizmoduck that is used to retrieve user information from a ReadableStore. The class takes in a ReadableStore of type Long and User as a parameter and an implicit StatsReceiver. \n\nThe getUser method in the class takes in a userId of type Long and returns a Future of type Option[User]. The method first tries to retrieve the user information from the userStore using the get method. If the retrieval is successful, the method returns the user information wrapped in an Option. If the retrieval fails, the method logs an error message using the Logger class and returns a Future.None. \n\nIn case of a failure, the method also increments a counter in the StatsReceiver object to keep track of the number of failures. The counter is scoped under \"getUserFailure\" and the name of the exception class is used as the counter name. \n\nThis class can be used in a larger project that requires user information to be retrieved from a ReadableStore. The class can be instantiated with the appropriate ReadableStore object and used to retrieve user information by calling the getUser method with the userId as a parameter. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval userStore: ReadableStore[Long, User] = // initialize userStore\nval gizmoduck = new Gizmoduck(userStore)(statsReceiver)\nval userId: Long = // get userId from somewhere\nval userFuture: Future[Option[User]] = gizmoduck.getUser(userId)\nuserFuture.onSuccess {\n  case Some(user) => // do something with user information\n  case None => // handle failure\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code defines a class called Gizmoduck that retrieves a user from a ReadableStore using their ID and returns a Future containing an Option of the User object.\n2. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n   - This code relies on several dependencies including com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver, com.twitter.gizmoduck.thriftscala.User, com.twitter.logging.Logger, com.twitter.storehaus.ReadableStore, and com.twitter.util.Future.\n3. What error handling is implemented in this code?\n   - This code implements error handling using the .rescue method to catch exceptions and log an error message. It also increments a counter in the statsReceiver for each type of exception encountered."

  "summary": "The `SocialWriteEventProcessor` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for listening to events from social graph services, with a particular focus on user-user follow events. \n\nThe class takes in several parameters, including the name of the event bus stream, the Thrift struct codec for the `WriteEvent` type, a service identifier, a Kafka event publisher, a user-user graph topic, and an event-to-message builder for `WriteEvent` and `UserUserEdge`. \n\nThe `processEvent` method is the main functionality of this class. It takes in a `WriteEvent` and returns a `Future` of `Unit`. The method first uses the `userUserGraphMessageBuilder` to process the event and generate a sequence of `UserUserEdge` objects. It then iterates through each edge and publishes it to the Kafka topic using the `kafkaEventPublisher`. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to process social graph events and generate user-user edges. These edges can then be used in other parts of the project, such as recommendation algorithms, to make personalized recommendations to users based on their social connections. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval processor = new SocialWriteEventProcessor(\n  \"social-graph-events\",\n  WriteEvent,\n  ServiceIdentifier(\"social-graph-service\"),\n  kafkaEventPublisher,\n  \"user-user-graph\",\n  new EventToMessageBuilder[WriteEvent, UserUserEdge] {\n    override def processEvent(event: WriteEvent): Seq[UserUserEdge] = {\n      // logic to generate UserUserEdges from WriteEvent\n    }\n  }\n)(statsReceiver)\n\n// start processing events\nprocessor.start()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a processor that listens to events from social graphs services, particularly user-user follow events. It processes these events and publishes them to a Kafka topic using a message builder.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Finagle, Scrooge, and Kafka. It also depends on custom classes such as EventToMessageBuilder and UserUserEdge.\n\n3. How does this code handle errors or exceptions?\n- The code does not have any explicit error handling or exception catching. Any errors or exceptions that occur during event processing or publishing will likely be propagated up the call stack."

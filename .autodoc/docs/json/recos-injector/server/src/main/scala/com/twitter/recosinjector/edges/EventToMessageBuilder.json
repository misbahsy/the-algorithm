  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `EventToMessageBuilder` that provides a generic interface for converting incoming events into edges for a specific output graph. The trait defines several methods that implement the following flow: event -> update event stats -> build edges -> filter edges. The trait also provides top-level statistics for each step, such as latency and number of events.\n\nThe `processEvent` method takes an incoming event and processes it by checking if it should be used to build edges. If the event should be used, the method updates the event status, builds edges, and filters the edges to return only the valid ones. The method returns a `Future` that contains a sequence of edges.\n\nThe `shouldProcessEvent` method is a pre-process filter that determines whether the given event should be used to build edges. The method returns a `Future[Boolean]`.\n\nThe `updateEventStatus` method updates cache/event logging related to the specific event. By default, no action will be taken. The method can be overridden when necessary.\n\nThe `buildEdges` method takes an event, extracts information, and builds a sequence of edges. The method returns a `Future` that contains a sequence of edges.\n\nThe `filterEdges` method takes an event and a sequence of edges, filters the edges, and returns only the valid ones. The method returns a `Future` that contains a sequence of edges.\n\nThis trait can be used in a larger project to convert incoming events into edges for a specific output graph. For example, in a social media platform like Twitter, incoming events could be tweets, likes, or retweets, and the output graph could be a recommendation graph that suggests users to follow based on their interests. The `EventToMessageBuilder` trait can be implemented for each type of event to build edges and filter them based on specific criteria. The trait also provides statistics for each step, which can be used to monitor the performance of the system. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass TweetEventToMessageBuilder extends EventToMessageBuilder[TweetEvent, TweetEdge] {\n  implicit val statsReceiver: StatsReceiver = ???\n\n  override def shouldProcessEvent(event: TweetEvent): Future[Boolean] = {\n    // Check if the tweet is relevant to the recommendation graph\n    // Return true if it is, false otherwise\n  }\n\n  override def buildEdges(event: TweetEvent): Future[Seq[TweetEdge]] = {\n    // Extract information from the tweet and build edges\n    // Return a sequence of TweetEdges\n  }\n\n  override def filterEdges(event: TweetEvent, edges: Seq[TweetEdge]): Future[Seq[TweetEdge]] = {\n    // Filter the edges based on specific criteria\n    // Return only the valid edges\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the larger project?\n- This code defines a trait for converting incoming events into edges for a specific output graph, with various statistics tracked along the way. It is likely used as part of a larger system for processing events and generating graph data.\n\n2. What types of events and edges does this code support?\n- The code is generic and takes in a type parameter for the incoming event and a type parameter for the output edge. The specific types used would depend on the implementation of this trait.\n\n3. What is the default behavior for `updateEventStatus` and how can it be overridden?\n- The default behavior for `updateEventStatus` is to do nothing. It can be overridden by implementing the method in a class that extends this trait and providing custom behavior."

  "summary": "The `SocialWriteEventToUserUserGraphBuilder` class is part of a larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for converting a `WriteEvent` to `UserUserGraph` messages, including Mention and Mediatag messages. \n\nThe class extends `EventToMessageBuilder` and overrides three methods: `shouldProcessEvent`, `buildEdges`, and `filterEdges`. \n\nThe `shouldProcessEvent` method determines whether an event should be processed. For now, the class is only interested in Follow events. If the event is a Follow or FrictionlessFollow event, the method increments the `followOrFrictionlessFollowCounter` and returns `true`. Otherwise, it increments the `notFollowOrFrictionlessFollowCounter` and returns `false`. \n\nThe `buildEdges` method is responsible for building the edges for a given event. It first checks if the event has any Follow events. If it does, it collects the valid Follow events and creates `UserUserEdge` objects for each one. The method increments the `followEdgeCounter` for each valid Follow event. \n\nThe `filterEdges` method is responsible for filtering the edges for a given event. In this case, it simply returns all the edges without any filtering. \n\nOverall, this class is an important part of the larger project as it converts events to messages that can be used to build a user-user graph. Here is an example of how this class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nval event = WriteEvent(...)\nval builder = new SocialWriteEventToUserUserGraphBuilder()\nval edges = builder.buildEdges(event)\n// do something with the edges\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a class that converts a WriteEvent to UserUserGraph's messages, specifically for Follow events.\n\n2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?\n- This code depends on several other packages and classes, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.recos.util.Action`, and `com.twitter.socialgraph.thriftscala`.\n\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n- The expected output of this code is a sequence of `UserUserEdge` objects, which represent Follow events in the UserUserGraph."

  "summary": "The `SocialGraph` class is a component of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for fetching user IDs from a social graph and returning a list of users who follow a given user and have not muted them. \n\nThe class takes a `ReadableStore` object as a constructor parameter, which is used to fetch user IDs from the social graph. The `fetchIdsFromSocialGraph` method is responsible for constructing a request to the social graph and returning a list of user IDs. This method takes the following parameters:\n\n- `userId`: the ID of the user whose followers are being queried\n- `ids`: a sequence of user IDs to query\n- `relationshipTypes`: a map of relationship types to boolean values indicating whether the relationship should be included in the query\n- `lookupContext`: an optional parameter indicating the context in which the query should be performed\n- `stats`: a `StatsReceiver` object used for logging statistics about the query\n\nThe `followedByNotMutedBy` method is a public method that takes a user ID and a sequence of candidate user IDs as parameters. It calls the `fetchIdsFromSocialGraph` method with the appropriate parameters to fetch the user IDs of users who follow the given user and have not muted them. \n\nThe `SocialGraph` object contains several constants used by the class. `SelectAllPageRequest` is a `PageRequest` object that selects all results. `IncludeInactiveLookupContext` and `IncludeInactiveUnionLookupContext` are `LookupContext` objects used to specify the context in which the query should be performed. `FollowedByNotMutedRelationships` is a map of relationship types to boolean values indicating which relationships should be included in the query.\n\nHere is an example of how the `SocialGraph` class might be used:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.storehaus.memory.MemoryStore\nimport com.twitter.util.Future\n\nval socialGraphIdStore = MemoryStore.empty[IdsRequest, IdsResult]\nval socialGraph = new SocialGraph(socialGraphIdStore)\n\nval userId = 12345L\nval candidates = Seq(67890L, 24680L, 13579L)\n\nval result: Future[Seq[Long]] = socialGraph.followedByNotMutedBy(userId, candidates)\nresult.foreach(ids => println(s\"Users who follow $userId and have not muted them: $ids\"))\n``` \n\nIn this example, a `MemoryStore` object is used as the `ReadableStore` parameter for the `SocialGraph` constructor. The `followedByNotMutedBy` method is called with a user ID and a sequence of candidate user IDs. The result is a `Future` object that will eventually contain a sequence of user IDs who follow the given user and have not muted them. The result is printed to the console when it becomes available.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the SocialGraph class?\n- The SocialGraph class is used to fetch user IDs from a social graph based on certain relationship types and lookup context.\n\n2. What is the difference between IncludeInactiveLookupContext and IncludeInactiveUnionLookupContext?\n- IncludeInactiveLookupContext includes inactive users in the lookup, while IncludeInactiveUnionLookupContext includes inactive users and performs a union operation on the results.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the followedByNotMutedBy method?\n- The followedByNotMutedBy method returns a Future containing the user IDs of candidates who follow a given user and have not muted them."

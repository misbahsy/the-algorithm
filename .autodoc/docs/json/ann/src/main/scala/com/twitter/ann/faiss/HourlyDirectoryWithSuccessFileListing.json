  "summary": "The `HourlyDirectoryWithSuccessFileListing` object provides a utility for listing directories containing successful hourly index files. The purpose of this code is to enable the retrieval of a list of directories containing hourly index files that have been successfully processed. This is useful in the context of a larger project that involves processing large amounts of data and indexing it for search. \n\nThe `listHourlyIndexDirectories` method takes in four parameters: `root`, `startingFrom`, `count`, and `lookbackInterval`. `root` is an `AbstractFile` object representing the root directory to search for hourly index directories. `startingFrom` is a `Time` object representing the starting time to search for hourly index directories. `count` is an integer representing the number of hourly index directories to retrieve. `lookbackInterval` is an integer representing the number of hours to look back from the `startingFrom` time. \n\nThe `listingStep` method is a recursive helper method that takes in four parameters: `root`, `startingFrom`, `remainingDirectoriesToFind`, and `remainingAttempts`. `root` and `startingFrom` are the same as in the `listHourlyIndexDirectories` method. `remainingDirectoriesToFind` is an integer representing the number of hourly index directories that still need to be found. `remainingAttempts` is an integer representing the number of attempts left to find the hourly index directories. \n\nThe `getSuccessfulDirectoryForDate` method takes in two parameters: `root` and `date`. `root` is an `AbstractFile` object representing the root directory to search for hourly index directories. `date` is a `Time` object representing the date and hour to search for a successful hourly index directory. \n\nThe `listHourlyIndexDirectories` method calls the `listingStep` method with the provided parameters. The `listingStep` method first checks if there are no more directories to find or no more attempts left. If either of these conditions is true, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it calls the `getSuccessfulDirectoryForDate` method with the `root` and `startingFrom` parameters. If the `getSuccessfulDirectoryForDate` method returns a successful directory, it adds it to the list of directories to return and calls `listingStep` again with the `previousHour` as the new `startingFrom` time and decrements the `remainingDirectoriesToFind` and `remainingAttempts` parameters. If the `getSuccessfulDirectoryForDate` method throws an exception, it calls `listingStep` again with the `previousHour` as the new `startingFrom` time and decrements the `remainingAttempts` parameter. \n\nThe `getSuccessfulDirectoryForDate` method constructs a file path based on the `root` and `date` parameters and checks if a success file exists in that directory. If the success file exists and is readable, it returns the directory. Otherwise, it throws an exception. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful utility for retrieving a list of directories containing successfully processed hourly index files. It can be used in the larger context of a project that involves processing and indexing large amounts of data for search.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides a function to list hourly index directories for a given root directory, starting from a specified time, and returning a specified number of directories within a specified lookback interval.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports several classes from external libraries, including `com.twitter.conversions.DurationOps`, `com.twitter.search.common.file`, and `com.twitter.util`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `_SUCCESS` file name?\n- The `_SUCCESS` file is used to indicate the successful completion of a Hadoop job, and in this code, it is used to identify directories that contain successfully completed hourly index files."

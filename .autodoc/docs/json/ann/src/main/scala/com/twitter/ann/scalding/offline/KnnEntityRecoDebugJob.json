  "summary": "The `KnnEntityRecoDebugJob` object in this file is a Scalding job that performs an exhaustive search for nearest neighbors. This job is useful for debugging recommendations for a given list of sample queryIds and entity embeddings for the recommendations to be made. \n\nThe job takes in several command-line arguments, including the number of neighbors to search for, the metric to use for distance calculation, the entity kind of the query, the entity kind of the search space, the paths to the query and search space embeddings, the format of the embeddings, the query IDs, the output path, and the number of reducers. \n\nThe `run` method is the main method that performs the nearest neighbor search. It takes in the uncast query entity kind, uncast search space entity kind, uncast metric, and command-line arguments. It then casts these arguments to their respective types and filters the query entity embeddings with the query IDs. It then gets the neighbor embeddings and uses the `findNearestNeighbours` method to find the nearest neighbors. Finally, it writes the nearest neighbor string to one part file. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to perform an exhaustive search for nearest neighbors, which can be useful for debugging recommendations. It can be used as a standalone job or as part of a larger project. An example of how to run this job is provided in the comments at the beginning of the file.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code performs an exhaustive search for nearest neighbors to aid in debugging recommendations for a given list of sample queryIds and entity embeddings for the recos to be made.\n2. What are the required inputs for this code to run?\n- The required inputs include the query entity kind, search space entity kind, metric, neighbors, query embedding path, query embedding format, search space embedding path, search space embedding format, query ids, output path, and reducers.\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n- The expected output of this code is a string representation of the nearest neighbors for the given queryIds and entity embeddings, written to a single part file."

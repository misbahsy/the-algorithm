  "summary": "The `MemoizedInEpochs` class is a memoization implementation that caches the results of a function `f` that takes a key of type `K` and returns a `Try` of a value of type `V`. The memoization is done in epochs, where each epoch is a set of keys that are passed to the `epoch` method. The class keeps track of the keys that have been memoized in previous epochs and reuses their values in subsequent epochs. The keys that are not in the cache are computed by calling `f` and their results are added to the cache. If `f` throws an exception, the key is skipped and a warning is logged.\n\nThe class has two main methods: `epoch` and `currentEpochKeys`. The `epoch` method takes a sequence of keys and returns a sequence of values. It first filters out the keys that are already in the cache and computes the values for the remaining keys by calling `f`. It then filters out the values that correspond to keys for which `f` threw an exception. Finally, it merges the values from the cache and the newly computed values and updates the cache. The method returns the values in the order of the input keys.\n\nThe `currentEpochKeys` method returns the set of keys that are currently in the cache.\n\nThis memoization implementation can be useful in situations where the function `f` is expensive to compute and the same keys are likely to be used multiple times. By caching the results and reusing them in subsequent epochs, the computation time can be reduced. The class can be used as follows:\n\n```scala\nval memoized = new MemoizedInEpochs((key: String) => Try {\n  // expensive computation\n})\n\nval keys = Seq(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nval values = memoized.epoch(keys)\n// compute values for keys \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" and cache them\n\nval moreKeys = Seq(\"b\", \"d\")\nval moreValues = memoized.epoch(moreKeys)\n// reuse value for key \"b\" from cache, compute value for key \"d\" and cache it\n\nval cachedKeys = memoized.currentEpochKeys\n// returns Set(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?\n- This code implements a memoization technique with a twist for a given function f that takes a key of type K and returns a Try of type V. It is used to cache the results of f for a set of keys and reuse them across epochs.\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on the com.twitter.util and com.twitter.util.logging packages, specifically the Return, Throw, Try, and Logging classes.\n3. What is the time complexity of the epoch method and how does it scale with the size of the input keys?\n- The time complexity of the epoch method depends on the size of the input keys and the number of keys that have not been memoized yet. It is O(n) where n is the number of keys to be computed minus the number of keys that have already been memoized. As the size of the input keys increases, the time complexity of the epoch method also increases linearly."

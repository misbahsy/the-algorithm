  "summary": "The HourlyShardedIndex class is a part of the The Algorithm from Twitter project and is used to load and manage a sharded index. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to load and manage a sharded index that is stored in a directory. The sharded index is loaded from a set of directories that contain hourly index files. The class provides a way to reload the index periodically and to keep track of the shards that have been loaded.\n\nThe HourlyShardedIndex class is a Scala class that extends the QueryableIndexAdapter class. The QueryableIndexAdapter class provides an interface for querying the index. The HourlyShardedIndex class also extends the Task trait, which provides a way to schedule a task to reload the index periodically.\n\nThe HourlyShardedIndex class has a loadIndex method that loads the index from a directory. The method returns a Try object that contains the index. The class also has a shardsCache object that caches the index shards in memory. The shardsCache object is a MemoizedInEpochs object that caches the index shards for a certain number of epochs.\n\nThe HourlyShardedIndex class has two AtomicReference objects that hold references to the original index and the casted index. The original index is an IndexShards object that holds the shards of the index. The casted index is an Index object that is casted from the IndexShards object. The HourlyShardedIndex class has a reloadShards method that reloads the index shards from the directory. The method gets a list of fresh directories that contain the hourly index files. The method then checks if the current epoch keys are the same as the fresh directories. If they are the same, the method does not reload the shards. If they are different, the method loads the shards from the fresh directories and replaces the index with the new index. The method also calls the System.gc() method to ask for garbage collection of the old index.\n\nThe HourlyShardedIndex class provides a loadIndex method that creates a new HourlyShardedIndex object. The method takes the dimension, metric, directory, shardsToLoad, shardWatchInterval, lookbackInterval, and statsReceiver as parameters. The method returns a new HourlyShardedIndex object.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval index = HourlyShardedIndex.loadIndex(\n  dimension = 100,\n  metric = L2Distance,\n  directory = new File(\"/path/to/index\"),\n  shardsToLoad = 10,\n  shardWatchInterval = 1.minute,\n  lookbackInterval = 1.hour,\n  statsReceiver = new NullStatsReceiver\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class and a companion object for loading and managing a sharded index used for querying data.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external libraries, including `com.twitter.ann.common`, `com.twitter.search.common.file`, and `com.twitter.util`.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `loadIndex` method?\n- The `loadIndex` method takes in several parameters related to the sharded index, including the dimension, metric, directory, and number of shards to load. It returns a `Try` object containing the loaded index."

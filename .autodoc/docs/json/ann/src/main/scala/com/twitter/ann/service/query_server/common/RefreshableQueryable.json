  "summary": "The `RefreshableQueryable` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to provide approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search functionality. It is a generic class that can be used with any type of data that can be represented as an embedding vector. \n\nThe class is initialized with a set of parameters including a boolean flag indicating whether the data is grouped, a root directory where the data is stored, a `QueryableProvider` object that provides the ANN index, an `IndexPathProvider` object that provides the path to the index, a `StatsReceiver` object for collecting statistics, and an update interval for refreshing the index. \n\nThe class implements the `QueryableGrouped` trait which provides two methods for querying the index: `query` and `queryWithDistance`. These methods take an embedding vector, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters that control the accuracy and latency of the search. The `query` method returns a list of approximate nearest neighbor ids, while the `queryWithDistance` method returns a list of neighbor ids with their corresponding distances from the query embedding. \n\nThe `RefreshableQueryable` class periodically checks for updates to the index and reloads it if necessary. It uses a single thread to check and load the index, and the update interval can be configured by the user. The class also provides methods for starting and stopping the update process. \n\nOverall, the `RefreshableQueryable` class provides a convenient way to perform ANN search on large datasets that are stored on disk. It allows for efficient querying of the data while also providing the ability to update the index as new data becomes available. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval queryable = new RefreshableQueryable[MyData, MyParams, MyDistance](\n  grouped = true,\n  rootDir = new File(\"/path/to/data\"),\n  queryableProvider = new MyQueryableProvider(),\n  indexPathProvider = new MyIndexPathProvider(),\n  statsReceiver = new MyStatsReceiver(),\n  updateInterval = 1.hour\n)\n\nqueryable.start()\n\nval embedding = MyData.toEmbeddingVector(data)\nval neighbors = queryable.query(embedding, 10, MyParams.defaultParams)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the RefreshableQueryable class?\n- The RefreshableQueryable class is a queryable index that can be refreshed periodically with new data. It implements the QueryableGrouped interface and provides methods for querying the index for nearest neighbors.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several libraries including Google Guava, Twitter Finagle, and Twitter Util. It also depends on a custom package called com.twitter.ann.\n\n3. How does the RefreshableQueryable class handle errors when loading new data?\n- The RefreshableQueryable class increments a loadFailCounter when an error occurs while loading new data. It also logs an error message with details about the failure. If an error occurs, the current index is not updated and the previous index is still used for queries."

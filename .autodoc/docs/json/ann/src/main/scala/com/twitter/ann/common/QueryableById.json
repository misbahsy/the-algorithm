  "summary": "The code defines a trait called QueryableById that allows querying for nearest neighbors given an arbitrary type T1. This is in contrast to a regular Appendable, which takes an embedding as the input argument. The trait has four methods: queryById, queryByIdWithDistance, batchQueryById, and batchQueryWithDistanceById. \n\nThe queryById method takes an id of type T1, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters of type P. It returns a Stitch object that contains a list of T2 objects, which are the nearest neighbors of the given id. \n\nThe queryByIdWithDistance method is similar to queryById, but it also returns the distance between the query id and each of its nearest neighbors. The result is a list of NeighborWithDistance objects, which contain both the T2 object and its distance from the query id. \n\nThe batchQueryById method takes a sequence of ids of type T1, the number of neighbors to return, and runtime parameters of type P. It returns a Stitch object that contains a list of NeighborWithSeed objects, which contain both the query id and its nearest neighbors of type T2. \n\nThe batchQueryWithDistanceById method is similar to batchQueryById, but it also returns the distance between each query id and its nearest neighbors. The result is a list of NeighborWithDistanceWithSeed objects, which contain both the query id, its nearest neighbors of type T2, and their distances. \n\nOverall, this trait provides a way to query for nearest neighbors using an arbitrary type T1, which can be useful in a variety of applications such as recommendation systems, search engines, and clustering algorithms. The use of the Stitch API for batching allows for efficient querying of large datasets. \n\nExample usage:\n\nAssuming we have a class called User with an id of type Int and an embedding of type Array[Double], we can define a QueryableById implementation as follows:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.ann.common._\n\nclass UserIndex(embeddings: Map[Int, Array[Double]]) extends QueryableById[Int, User, RuntimeParams, EuclideanDistance] {\n  val index = new AnnoyIndex(embeddings.values.toSeq)\n\n  def queryById(id: Int, numOfNeighbors: Int, runtimeParams: RuntimeParams): Stitch[List[User]] = {\n    val neighbors = index.getNearestNeighbors(embeddings(id), numOfNeighbors)\n    Stitch.value(neighbors.map(id => User(id, embeddings(id)).toList)\n  }\n\n  def queryByIdWithDistance(id: Int, numOfNeighbors: Int, runtimeParams: RuntimeParams): Stitch[List[NeighborWithDistance[User, EuclideanDistance]]] = {\n    val neighbors = index.getNearestNeighborsWithDistance(embeddings(id), numOfNeighbors)\n    Stitch.value(neighbors.map { case (id, distance) => NeighborWithDistance(User(id, embeddings(id)), distance) }.toList)\n  }\n\n  def batchQueryById(ids: Seq[Int], numOfNeighbors: Int, runtimeParams: RuntimeParams): Stitch[List[NeighborWithSeed[Int, User]]] = {\n    val neighbors = ids.map(id => (id, index.getNearestNeighbors(embeddings(id), numOfNeighbors)))\n    Stitch.value(neighbors.map { case (id, neighbors) => NeighborWithSeed(id, neighbors.map(id => User(id, embeddings(id)))) }.toList)\n  }\n\n  def batchQueryWithDistanceById(ids: Seq[Int], numOfNeighbors: Int, runtimeParams: RuntimeParams): Stitch[List[NeighborWithDistanceWithSeed[Int, User, EuclideanDistance]]] = {\n    val neighbors = ids.map(id => (id, index.getNearestNeighborsWithDistance(embeddings(id), numOfNeighbors)))\n    Stitch.value(neighbors.map { case (id, neighbors) => NeighborWithDistanceWithSeed(id, neighbors.map { case (id, distance) => NeighborWithDistance(User(id, embeddings(id)), distance) }) }.toList)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a UserIndex class that takes a map of user ids to their embeddings as input. We use the AnnoyIndex implementation to perform nearest neighbor queries. We then implement the four methods of the QueryableById trait using the AnnoyIndex API. \n\nWe can then use this UserIndex class to query for nearest neighbors of users as follows:\n\n```\nval userIndex = new UserIndex(embeddings)\nval userId = 123\nval numOfNeighbors = 10\nval runtimeParams = new RuntimeParams()\nval neighbors = userIndex.queryById(userId, numOfNeighbors, runtimeParams).get()\nprintln(neighbors)\n```\n\nThis code queries for the 10 nearest neighbors of the user with id 123 using the queryById method. The result is a list of User objects that represent the nearest neighbors.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a trait called QueryableById that allows for querying nearest neighbors given an arbitrary type T1, using the Stitch API for batching. It solves the problem of finding nearest neighbors efficiently.\n\n2. What are the required input parameters for the queryById and batchQueryById methods?\n- Both queryById and batchQueryById methods require the input parameter id or ids of type T1, the number of neighbors to query for, and runtimeParams of type P.\n\n3. What is the difference between the queryByIdWithDistance and batchQueryWithDistanceById methods?\n- The queryByIdWithDistance method returns a list of NeighborWithDistance objects, which contain both the neighbor and the distance to that neighbor. The batchQueryWithDistanceById method returns a list of NeighborWithDistanceWithSeed objects, which contain both the neighbor, the distance to that neighbor, and the seed id used for the query."

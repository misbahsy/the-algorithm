  "summary": "The code defines a trait called FollowGraphDataProvider that provides methods for obtaining follow graph data for a given user on Twitter. The follow graph data represents the users that a given user follows on Twitter. \n\nThe trait has four methods:\n1. get(userId: UserId, maxFollowingCount: Int): Future[FollowGraphData]\nThis method takes a UserId and a maximum number of followed user IDs to fetch as input parameters and returns a Future[FollowGraphData]. The FollowGraphData represents the follow graph details for the given user. If the given user follows more than the maximum number of users specified, then the most recent maxFollowingCount users are returned.\n\n2. getAsync(userId: UserId, maxFollowingCount: Int): FollowGraphDataFuture\nThis method takes a UserId and a maximum number of followed user IDs to fetch as input parameters and returns a FollowGraphDataFuture. This method is similar to the get method, but it returns a FollowGraphDataFuture instead of a Future[FollowGraphData]. \n\n3. getFollowing(userId: UserId, maxFollowingCount: Int): Future[Seq[UserId]]\nThis method takes a UserId and a maximum number of followed user IDs to fetch as input parameters and returns a Future[Seq[UserId]]. This method returns the user IDs of the users that the given user follows on Twitter.\n\n4. getMutuallyFollowingUserIds(userId: UserId, followingIds: Seq[UserId]): Future[Set[UserId]]\nThis method takes a UserId and a sequence of user IDs as input parameters and returns a Future[Set[UserId]]. This method returns the user IDs of the users that the given user and the users in the followingIds sequence mutually follow on Twitter.\n\nThis trait can be used in the larger project to obtain follow graph data for a given user and to find the users that a given user follows on Twitter. This data can be used for various purposes such as ranking the timelines of users based on their follow graph data. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval followGraphDataProvider: FollowGraphDataProvider = new FollowGraphDataProviderImpl()\nval userId: UserId = UserId(123456789)\nval maxFollowingCount: Int = 100\nval followGraphDataFuture: FollowGraphDataFuture = followGraphDataProvider.getAsync(userId, maxFollowingCount)\nval followGraphData: FollowGraphData = Await.result(followGraphDataFuture)\nval followingUserIdsFuture: Future[Seq[UserId]] = followGraphDataProvider.getFollowing(userId, maxFollowingCount)\nval followingUserIds: Seq[UserId] = Await.result(followingUserIdsFuture)\nval mutuallyFollowingUserIdsFuture: Future[Set[UserId]] = followGraphDataProvider.getMutuallyFollowingUserIds(userId, followingUserIds)\nval mutuallyFollowingUserIds: Set[UserId] = Await.result(mutuallyFollowingUserIdsFuture)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code defines a trait called FollowGraphDataProvider that provides methods for obtaining follow graph data for a given user, including the user's followed user IDs and mutually followed user IDs.\n\n2. What other classes or packages does this code depend on?\n- This code depends on classes from the com.twitter.timelineranker.core and com.twitter.timelines.model packages.\n\n3. What is the difference between the get and getAsync methods?\n- The get method returns a Future object that will eventually contain the follow graph data, while the getAsync method returns a FollowGraphDataFuture object that can be used to obtain the follow graph data asynchronously."

  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `EntityTweetsRepository` that serves as a repository for entity tweet candidates. It takes an instance of `EntityTweetsSource` as a parameter in its constructor. \n\nThe `EntityTweetsRepository` class has two methods: `get` and `get` that take a `RecapQuery` and a sequence of `RecapQuery` objects respectively. Both methods return a `Future` object that contains either a single `CandidateTweetsResult` or a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult` objects.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a way to retrieve entity tweet candidates from an underlying source. It acts as an intermediary between the source and any other part of the project that needs to access the entity tweet candidates. \n\nThe `EntityTweetsRepository` class does not cache any results, so it simply forwards all calls to the underlying source. This means that every time a call is made to retrieve entity tweet candidates, the source will be queried. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project by any component that needs to access entity tweet candidates. For example, if there is a component that ranks tweets based on their relevance to a particular topic, it can use the `EntityTweetsRepository` class to retrieve the relevant tweets and then rank them accordingly. \n\nHere is an example of how the `get` method can be used:\n\n```\nval repository = new EntityTweetsRepository(source)\nval query = RecapQuery(\"topic\")\nval futureResult = repository.get(query)\n\nfutureResult onSuccess { result =>\n  // do something with the result\n}\n\nfutureResult onFailure { throwable =>\n  // handle the error\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of `EntityTweetsRepository` is created with an instance of `EntityTweetsSource` called `source`. A `RecapQuery` object is created with the topic of interest and passed to the `get` method of the repository. The `Future` object returned by the `get` method is then used to handle the result or any errors that may occur.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a repository class for entity tweet candidates and provides methods to retrieve candidate tweets results from an underlying source.\n\n2. What is the expected behavior if the underlying source is not able to provide the requested data?\n- It is not specified in the code what the behavior would be if the underlying source is not able to provide the requested data.\n\n3. Is there any plan to add caching functionality to this repository in the future?\n- It is not specified in the code whether there is a plan to add caching functionality to this repository in the future."

  "summary": "The HydrateTweetsAndSourceTweetsInParallelTransform class is a transformation that explicitly hydrates candidate tweets and fetches source tweets in parallel, and then joins the results back into the original Envelope. This class takes two parameters, candidateTweetHydration and sourceTweetHydration, which are pipelines that hydrate candidate tweets and fetch and hydrate source tweets, respectively.\n\nThe apply method of this class takes a CandidateEnvelope as input and returns a Future of CandidateEnvelope. The method uses the Future.join method to execute the candidateTweetHydration and sourceTweetHydration pipelines in parallel. The join method returns a Future of a tuple containing the results of both pipelines. The map method is then used to extract the results of each pipeline and combine them into a new CandidateEnvelope.\n\nThe resulting CandidateEnvelope contains the hydratedTweets from the candidateTweetEnvelope, the sourceSearchResults from the sourceTweetEnvelope, and the sourceHydratedTweets from the sourceTweetEnvelope. This transformation is useful in cases where candidate tweets and source tweets need to be hydrated and fetched in parallel to improve performance.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval candidateTweetHydrationPipeline = new CandidateTweetHydrationPipeline()\nval sourceTweetHydrationPipeline = new SourceTweetHydrationPipeline()\nval hydrateTransform = new HydrateTweetsAndSourceTweetsInParallelTransform(candidateTweetHydrationPipeline, sourceTweetHydrationPipeline)\n\nval candidateEnvelope = new CandidateEnvelope(...)\nval hydratedEnvelopeFuture = hydrateTransform(candidateEnvelope)\n\nhydratedEnvelopeFuture.onSuccess { hydratedEnvelope =>\n  // Do something with the hydrated envelope\n}\n\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `HydrateTweetsAndSourceTweetsInParallelTransform` that is used to hydrate candidate tweets and fetch source tweets in parallel.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of this class?\n- The input is a `CandidateEnvelope` object, and the output is also a `CandidateEnvelope` object.\n\n3. What other classes or libraries does this code depend on?\n- This code depends on the `FutureArrow` class from the `com.twitter.servo.util` package and the `CandidateEnvelope` class from the `com.twitter.timelineranker.core` package."

  "summary": "The code above defines a Scala class called `UtegLikedByTweetsRepository` that serves as a repository for YML tweets candidates. The class takes in a `UtegLikedByTweetsSource` object as a parameter in its constructor. The `UtegLikedByTweetsSource` object is responsible for retrieving the YML tweets candidates.\n\nThe class has two methods: `get(query: RecapQuery)` and `get(queries: Seq[RecapQuery])`. The `get(query: RecapQuery)` method takes in a `RecapQuery` object and returns a `Future` of `CandidateTweetsResult`. The `RecapQuery` object is a query object that contains parameters for retrieving the YML tweets candidates. The `Future` object is a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in the future. The `CandidateTweetsResult` object is a model object that contains the YML tweets candidates.\n\nThe `get(queries: Seq[RecapQuery])` method takes in a sequence of `RecapQuery` objects and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult` objects. This method is useful when retrieving multiple YML tweets candidates at once.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to retrieve YML tweets candidates for analysis and ranking. The `UtegLikedByTweetsRepository` class serves as an abstraction layer between the data source and the code that uses the YML tweets candidates. This allows for easier maintenance and testing of the codebase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval source = new UtegLikedByTweetsSource()\nval repository = new UtegLikedByTweetsRepository(source)\n\nval query = RecapQuery(\"some parameter\")\nval futureResult = repository.get(query)\n\nfutureResult.onSuccess { result =>\n  // do something with the CandidateTweetsResult object\n}\n\nval queries = Seq(RecapQuery(\"param1\"), RecapQuery(\"param2\"))\nval futureResults = repository.get(queries)\n\nfutureResults.onSuccess { results =>\n  // do something with the sequence of CandidateTweetsResult objects\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   This code defines a repository class for YML tweets candidates and provides two methods to retrieve candidate tweets results based on a single query or a sequence of queries.\n\n2. What is the `UtegLikedByTweetsSource` class and where is it defined?\n   The `UtegLikedByTweetsSource` class is a dependency of the `UtegLikedByTweetsRepository` class and is not defined in this file. It is likely defined in another file or library.\n\n3. What is the return type of the `get` methods and what does it contain?\n   The return type of the `get` methods is a `Future` that contains either a single `CandidateTweetsResult` or a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult`, depending on the method called. The `CandidateTweetsResult` likely contains information about tweets that are candidates for a particular analysis or ranking."

  "summary": "The `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata` class is used to perform post-filtering on tweets obtained from search using metadata returned from search. The purpose of this class is to address certain shortcomings of the search process by post-processing search results using the returned metadata. \n\nThe class takes in a set of tweet filters based on search metadata, a logger, and a stats receiver. It also has a method called `apply` that takes in a user ID, a sequence of user IDs, a sequence of tweets, and the number of retweets allowed. The method returns a sequence of tweets that have been filtered based on the search metadata. \n\nThe `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata` class uses an object called `TweetFiltersBasedOnSearchMetadata` that extends the `Enumeration` class. This object defines two values: `DuplicateRetweets` and `DuplicateTweets`. It also defines a value set called `None` that is empty. The object also defines a case class called `MutableState` that has a mutable map called `seenTweetIds` that is used to keep track of the tweets that have been seen. \n\nThe `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata` class also has an object called `FiltersBasedOnSearchMetadata` that defines two methods: `isDuplicateTweet` and `isDuplicateRetweet`. These methods are used to determine whether a tweet is a duplicate tweet or a duplicate retweet. The `isDuplicateTweet` method checks if the tweet has already been seen, while the `isDuplicateRetweet` method checks if the source tweet of the retweet has already been seen. \n\nThe `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata` class uses the `applicableFilters` method to get the applicable filters based on the search metadata. It then uses the `filter` method to filter the tweets based on the applicable filters. The `filter` method takes in a sequence of tweets and a `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadataParams` object that contains the user ID, the sequence of user IDs, the number of retweets allowed, and a logging prefix. The method then uses a `MutableState` object to keep track of the tweets that have been seen. \n\nOverall, the `TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata` class is an important part of the larger project as it helps to address certain shortcomings of the search process by post-processing search results using the returned metadata. It is used to filter tweets based on the search metadata and can be used to improve the accuracy of search results. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval tweetFilters = TweetFiltersBasedOnSearchMetadata.DuplicateRetweets\nval logger = Logger.get(getClass)\nval statsReceiver = new InMemoryStatsReceiver\nval tweetPostFilter = new TweetsPostFilterBasedOnSearchMetadata(tweetFilters, logger, statsReceiver)\n\nval userId = UserId(123)\nval inNetworkUserIds = Seq(UserId(456), UserId(789))\nval tweets = Seq(ThriftSearchResult(...), ThriftSearchResult(...))\nval numRetweetsAllowed = 1\n\nval filteredTweets = tweetPostFilter.apply(userId, inNetworkUserIds, tweets, numRetweetsAllowed)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code performs post-filtering on tweets obtained from search using metadata returned from search.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The inputs of the `apply` method are a `userId`, a sequence of `inNetworkUserIds`, a sequence of `tweets`, and an optional `numRetweetsAllowed`. The output is a sequence of `ThriftSearchResult`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `FiltersBasedOnSearchMetadata` object?\n- The `FiltersBasedOnSearchMetadata` object contains methods that determine whether a tweet should be filtered out based on its metadata, such as whether it is a duplicate tweet or a duplicate retweet."

  "summary": "This code defines two type aliases and two objects in the `core` package object. The purpose of this code is to provide type aliases for two classes from the `configapi` package that are used in the `timelineranker` package. \n\nThe first type alias is `FutureDependencyTransformer[-U, +V]`, which is defined as a type alias for `configapi.FutureDependencyTransformer[RecapQuery, U, V]`. This type alias is used to transform a `Future` of type `U` into a `Future` of type `V`, given a `RecapQuery`. The `RecapQuery` class is defined in the `timelineranker.model` package. \n\nThe second type alias is `DependencyTransformer[-U, +V]`, which is defined as a type alias for `configapi.DependencyTransformer[RecapQuery, U, V]`. This type alias is used to transform a value of type `U` into a value of type `V`, given a `RecapQuery`. \n\nThe two objects defined in this code are `FutureDependencyTransformer` and `DependencyTransformer`. These objects extend the `configapi.FutureDependencyTransformerFunctions` and `configapi.DependencyTransformerFunctions` classes, respectively. These objects provide additional functions for working with the `FutureDependencyTransformer` and `DependencyTransformer` type aliases. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to transform values and futures given a `RecapQuery`. It is likely used in the larger project to transform data for use in the timeline ranking algorithm. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nimport com.twitter.timelineranker.core._\n\nval transformer: DependencyTransformer[Int, String] = ???\nval recapQuery: RecapQuery = ???\n\nval transformedValue: String = transformer.transform(42, recapQuery)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines type aliases and objects for future and dependency transformers in the `com.twitter.timelineranker` package.\n\n2. What is the relationship between `RecapQuery` and the transformers?\n   - The transformers defined in this code use `RecapQuery` as a type parameter to transform dependencies and futures.\n\n3. What is the `configapi` package used for?\n   - The `configapi` package is imported and used to define the transformers in this code. It is likely a separate library or module that provides functionality for dependency and future transformations."

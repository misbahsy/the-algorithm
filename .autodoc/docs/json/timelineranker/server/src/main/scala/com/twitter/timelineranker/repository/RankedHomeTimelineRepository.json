  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `RankedHomeTimelineRepository` that extends the `TimelineRepository` class. The purpose of this class is to act as a repository for ranked home timelines. \n\nThe `get` method of this class takes in a sequence of `TimelineQuery` objects and returns a sequence of `Future[Timeline]` objects. The `TimelineQuery` object represents a query for a user's home timeline, which is a collection of tweets from users that the user follows. The `Future[Timeline]` object represents a timeline that will be available at some point in the future.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the `get` method simply returns a sequence of `Future` objects that throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message \"ranked timelines are not yet supported.\" This means that the functionality to actually retrieve ranked home timelines is not yet implemented.\n\nIn the larger project, this class may be used as a placeholder for the functionality to retrieve ranked home timelines. Other parts of the project may depend on this class being present and may call its `get` method with the expectation of receiving ranked home timelines in the future. \n\nHere is an example of how this class may be used:\n\n```\nval repository = new RankedHomeTimelineRepository()\nval queries = Seq(TimelineQuery(userId = 1234))\nval timelines = repository.get(queries)\ntimelines.foreach { timeline =>\n  timeline.onSuccess { case timeline => \n    // do something with the retrieved timeline\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of `RankedHomeTimelineRepository` is created and a single `TimelineQuery` object is created with a user ID of 1234. The `get` method is called with this query, which returns a sequence of `Future` objects. The `foreach` method is called on this sequence to iterate over each `Future` object and attach a callback function to be executed when the timeline is successfully retrieved.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a repository class for ranked home timelines in the Twitter TimelineRanker project.\n\n2. What other classes or dependencies does this code rely on?\n   This code relies on the Timeline and TimelineQuery classes from the same project, as well as the Future class from the Twitter util library.\n\n3. Why does the get method always return an exception?\n   The get method is not yet implemented for ranked timelines, so it always throws an UnsupportedOperationException to indicate that this feature is not yet supported."

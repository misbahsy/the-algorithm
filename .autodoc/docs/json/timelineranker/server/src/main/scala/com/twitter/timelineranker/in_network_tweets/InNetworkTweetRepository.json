  "summary": "The `InNetworkTweetRepository` class is a repository of in-network tweet candidates. It takes in two parameters, `source` and `realtimeCGSource`, both of which are instances of the `InNetworkTweetSource` class. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to retrieve candidate tweets based on a `RecapQuery` object. \n\nThe `get` method takes in a `RecapQuery` object and returns a `Future` of `CandidateTweetsResult`. If the `enableRealtimeCGProvider` function returns true for the given query, the `realtimeCGSource` is used to retrieve the candidate tweets. Otherwise, the `source` is used. \n\nThe `get` method is overloaded to take in a sequence of `RecapQuery` objects and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult`. It does this by using the `Future.collect` method to asynchronously retrieve the candidate tweets for each query in the sequence. \n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to provide a way to retrieve candidate tweets for a given `RecapQuery`. The `InNetworkTweetSource` instances passed in as parameters are likely different sources of candidate tweets, such as a cache or a real-time stream. The `enableRealtimeCGProvider` function is likely used to determine whether to use the real-time stream or not based on a project-specific parameter. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval repo = new InNetworkTweetRepository(cacheSource, realtimeStreamSource)\nval query = RecapQuery(...)\nval resultFuture = repo.get(query)\nresultFuture.onSuccess { result =>\n  // do something with the candidate tweets result\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a repository for in-network tweet candidates and provides methods to retrieve them from an underlying source.\n2. What is the difference between the `get` methods?\n   - The first `get` method retrieves a single `CandidateTweetsResult` for a given `RecapQuery`, while the second `get` method retrieves a sequence of `CandidateTweetsResult` for multiple `RecapQuery` objects.\n3. Why is there a `DependencyProvider` used in this code?\n   - The `DependencyProvider` is used to check whether the `EnableEarlybirdRealtimeCgMigrationParam` parameter is enabled for a given `RecapQuery`. If it is enabled, the `realtimeCGSource` is used to retrieve the tweet candidates instead of the `source`."

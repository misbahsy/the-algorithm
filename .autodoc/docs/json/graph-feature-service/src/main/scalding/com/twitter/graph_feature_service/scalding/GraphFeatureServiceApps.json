  "summary": "This code defines two objects, `GraphFeatureServiceAdhocApp` and `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledApp`, which are used to launch and schedule a Scalding job for the Graph Feature Service. The Scalding job is responsible for generating graphs based on data from Twitter's social graph. \n\nThe `GraphFeatureServiceAdhocApp` object is used to launch an adhoc run of the Scalding job. This can be done by running the following command: \n\n```\nscalding remote run --target graph-feature-service/src/main/scalding/com/twitter/graph_feature_service/scalding:graph_feature_service_adhoc_job\n```\n\nThe `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledApp` object is used to schedule the Scalding job to run on a regular basis. This can be done by uploading the workflows config and specifying a cron schedule. The following command can be used to upload the workflows config and schedule the job to run on the first day of every month at 11:20 PM: \n\n```\nscalding workflow upload --jobs graph-feature-service/src/main/scalding/com/twitter/graph_feature_service/scalding:graph_feature_service_daily_job --autoplay --build-cron-schedule \"20 23 1 * *\"\n```\n\nThe `GraphFeatureServiceScheduledApp` object also overrides the `runOnDateRange` method to specify when to run the value graphs. The value graphs are only run on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The key graphs are disabled since they are not used in production. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to launch and schedule a Scalding job for the Graph Feature Service. The job generates graphs based on data from Twitter's social graph, and the adhoc and scheduled runs allow for flexibility in when the graphs are generated.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is part of a project called The Algorithm from Twitter and it appears to be related to scheduling and running jobs for a graph feature service. \n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several Scalding libraries, including DateRange, Execution, RichDate, and UniqueID. \n\n3. What is the difference between the GraphFeatureServiceAdhocApp and GraphFeatureServiceScheduledApp objects?\n- The GraphFeatureServiceAdhocApp object is used to launch an adhoc run of the job, while the GraphFeatureServiceScheduledApp object is used to schedule the job to run automatically on a monthly basis. The latter object also overrides the runOnDateRange method to specify when to run the value Graphs."

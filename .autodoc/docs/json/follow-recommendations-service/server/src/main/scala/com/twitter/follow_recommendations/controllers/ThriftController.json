  "summary": "The code above is a Scala class that serves as a Thrift controller for the Follow Recommendations service at Twitter. The purpose of this controller is to handle incoming Thrift requests and route them to the appropriate service methods for processing. \n\nThe class imports several dependencies from other packages, including `com.twitter.finatra.thrift.Controller`, which is a framework for building Thrift services on top of the Finatra web framework. The other dependencies include various classes and services related to user scoring, product pipelines, and parameter factories. \n\nThe `ThriftController` class has two main methods for handling incoming Thrift requests: `handle(GetRecommendations)` and `handle(ScoreUserCandidates)`. The former method takes a `GetRecommendations.Args` object as input and uses it to build a recommendation request using the `recommendationRequestBuilder` and `paramsFactory` objects. It then selects the appropriate product pipeline using the `productPipelineSelector` object and runs the request using the `Stitch.run` method. The latter method takes a `ScoreUserCandidates.Args` object as input and uses it to build a scoring request using the `scoringUserRequestBuilder` and `paramsFactory` objects. It then runs the request using the `userScoringService` object and returns the results as a Thrift response.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a crucial component of the Follow Recommendations service at Twitter, allowing it to handle incoming Thrift requests and route them to the appropriate service methods for processing. Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```scala\n// create a new instance of the ThriftController class\nval controller = new ThriftController(\n  userScoringService = new UserScoringService(),\n  recommendationRequestBuilder = new RecommendationRequestBuilder(),\n  scoringUserRequestBuilder = new ScoringUserRequestBuilder(),\n  productPipelineSelector = new ProductPipelineSelector(),\n  paramsFactory = new ParamsFactory()\n)\n\n// start the Thrift server and bind it to a port\nval server = Thrift.server.serveIface(\":8080\", controller)\n``` \n\nThis example creates a new instance of the `ThriftController` class and starts a Thrift server on port 8080, allowing clients to connect and send Thrift requests to the Follow Recommendations service.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a ThriftController for the FollowRecommendationsThriftService, which handles requests for recommendations and user scoring.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports several classes from other packages, including com.twitter.finatra.thrift.Controller, com.twitter.follow_recommendations.configapi.ParamsFactory, and com.twitter.follow_recommendations.services.UserScoringService.\n\n3. What is the role of the Stitch library in this code?\n- The Stitch library is used to execute asynchronous computations in a synchronous manner, and is used in this code to run the recommendation and user scoring requests."

  "summary": "The `CandidateUserContextFactory` class is responsible for creating a context for a candidate user, which includes feature switches that determine which features are enabled for that user. This context is used to make recommendations for users to follow on Twitter.\n\nThe class is a singleton and is injected with a `FeatureSwitches` object and a `Decider` object. The `FeatureSwitches` object contains information about which feature switches are enabled for the user, while the `Decider` object is used to determine which recommendations to make based on the user's context.\n\nThe `apply` method takes a `CandidateUser` object and a `DisplayLocation` object as input and returns a `CandidateUserContext` object. The `CandidateUserContext` object contains the user's ID and the feature context.\n\nThe `getFeatureContext` method takes a `CandidateUser` object and a `DisplayLocation` object as input and returns a `FeatureContext` object. The `FeatureContext` object is created using the `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext` class, which takes a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object as input. The `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object is created using the `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method, which takes a `CandidateUser` object as input and returns a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object. The `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object contains information about the user, such as their ID, language code, and country code.\n\nThe `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method creates a `FeatureSwitchRecipient` object using the `userId` field of the `CandidateUser` object and sets the other fields to `None`.\n\nOverall, the `CandidateUserContextFactory` class is an important part of the recommendation system for Twitter. It creates a context for a candidate user that includes feature switches, which are used to determine which recommendations to make. The class is designed to be easily testable, with a `getFeatureSwitchRecipient` method that is visible for testing.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a Scala class that creates a context for a candidate user in the Twitter follow recommendations feature. It uses feature switches to determine which recommendations to show to the user.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on several other classes and packages, including `Decider` and `FeatureSwitches` from the Twitter API, and `CandidateUser` and `DisplayLocation` models from the same project.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?\n- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to specify which constructor to use when creating an instance of this class, and which dependencies to inject into it."

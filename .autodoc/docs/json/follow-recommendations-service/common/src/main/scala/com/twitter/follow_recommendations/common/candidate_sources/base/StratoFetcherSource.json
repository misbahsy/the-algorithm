  "summary": "The code defines an abstract class called `StratoFetcherSource` that extends the `CandidateSource` interface. This class is used as a base for creating candidate sources for Twitter's follow recommendations feature. \n\nThe `StratoFetcherSource` class takes three type parameters: `K`, `U`, and `V`. These parameters represent the types of the key, view, and value used by the `Fetcher` object that is passed to the class constructor. The `Fetcher` object is used to retrieve data from a data store. The `view` parameter represents the view of the data that should be fetched, and the `identifier` parameter represents the identifier for the candidate source.\n\nThe `map` method is an abstract method that must be implemented by any concrete subclass of `StratoFetcherSource`. This method takes a key of type `K` and a value of type `V` and returns a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. The purpose of this method is to map the fetched data to a sequence of candidate users.\n\nThe `apply` method is an implementation of the `CandidateSource` interface's `apply` method. This method takes a target of type `K` and returns a `Stitch` object that represents a computation that will eventually produce a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. The `fetcher` object is used to fetch data from the data store using the `target` and `view` parameters. The `map` method is then called on the fetched data to produce a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects. Finally, the `withCandidateSource` method is called on each `CandidateUser` object in the sequence to set the candidate source identifier.\n\nOverall, this code provides a base class for creating candidate sources for Twitter's follow recommendations feature. Concrete subclasses of `StratoFetcherSource` can be created to fetch data from different data stores and map the data to candidate users. The `apply` method can then be used to retrieve a sequence of candidate users for a given target. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\n// Create a concrete subclass of StratoFetcherSource\nclass MyFetcherSource(fetcher: Fetcher[String, MyView, MyData], view: MyView, identifier: CandidateSourceIdentifier)\n  extends StratoFetcherSource[String, MyView, MyData](fetcher, view, identifier) {\n  \n  override def map(user: String, v: MyData): Seq[CandidateUser] = {\n    // Map the fetched data to a sequence of CandidateUser objects\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n// Create an instance of MyFetcherSource\nval mySource = new MyFetcherSource(myFetcher, myView, myIdentifier)\n\n// Use the apply method to retrieve a sequence of candidate users for a given target\nval target = \"myTarget\"\nval candidates = mySource.apply(target).run()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall project?\n- This code defines an abstract class for a candidate source that fetches data from a Strato server. It likely serves as a base for other candidate sources in the project.\n\n2. What are the types of K, U, and V and how are they used in the code?\n- K, U, and V are type parameters for the abstract class. They are used in the constructor to initialize the fetcher and view, and in the map method to transform the fetched data into CandidateUser objects.\n\n3. What is the role of the Stitch class and how is it used in the apply method?\n- The Stitch class is used to asynchronously fetch data from the Strato server. In the apply method, it is used to fetch data for a given target (user) and view, and then map the fetched data to CandidateUser objects with the withCandidateSource method."

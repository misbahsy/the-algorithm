  "summary": "The `EmailStorageServiceClient` class is a client for the Email Storage Service API. It is responsible for retrieving a verified email address for a given user ID and purpose of processing. \n\nThe class imports several ThriftScala classes from the `com.twitter.emailstorage.api.thriftscala` and `com.twitter.cds.contact_consent_state.thriftscala` packages. These classes are used to define the request and response types for the Email Storage Service API.\n\nThe `EmailStorageServiceClient` class is annotated with `@Singleton`, indicating that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The class is also annotated with `@Inject`, indicating that it can be injected with an instance of the `EmailStorageService.MethodPerEndpoint` class.\n\nThe `getVerifiedEmail` method takes a `userId` and `purposeOfProcessing` as input parameters. It constructs a `GetUsersEmailsRequest` object with the given `userId` and `purposeOfProcessing`, and sends the request to the Email Storage Service API using the `emailStorageService` instance. The response is then processed to extract the verified email address for the given user ID.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to retrieve verified email addresses for users, which can be used for various purposes such as sending notifications or recommendations. Here is an example of how this class can be used:\n\n```\nval emailStorageServiceClient = new EmailStorageServiceClient(emailStorageService)\nval userId = 12345\nval purposeOfProcessing = PurposeOfProcessing.FollowRecommendations\nval verifiedEmail = emailStorageServiceClient.getVerifiedEmail(userId, purposeOfProcessing).get\nprintln(s\"Verified email for user $userId: $verifiedEmail\")\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the EmailStorageServiceClient class?\n- The EmailStorageServiceClient class is a singleton that provides a method for retrieving a verified email address for a given user ID and purpose of processing.\n\n2. What external libraries or services does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on the com.twitter.cds.contact_consent_state.thriftscala and com.twitter.emailstorage.api.thriftscala libraries, as well as the Stitch library for handling asynchronous calls.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the getVerifiedEmail method?\n- The getVerifiedEmail method is expected to return a Stitch object that resolves to an optional string representing the user's verified email address."

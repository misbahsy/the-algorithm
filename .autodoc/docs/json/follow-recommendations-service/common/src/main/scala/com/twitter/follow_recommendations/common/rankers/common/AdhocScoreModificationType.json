  "summary": "The code defines an enumeration object called AdhocScoreModificationType that is used to manage the extent of adhoc score modifications in the larger project. Adhoc score modifications are modifications made to the scores of candidates in order to improve the accuracy of recommendations made by the algorithm. \n\nThe AdhocScoreModificationType enumeration object has three possible values: BoostingScorer, WeightedRandomSamplingScorer, and InvalidAdhocScorer. BoostingScorer is a type of scorer that increases the score of a subset of candidates through various policies. WeightedRandomSamplingScorer is a type of scorer that shuffles candidates randomly according to some distribution. InvalidAdhocScorer is added solely for testing purposes and should not be used in production. \n\nThe purpose of this enumeration object is to set a hard limit that from each of the types above, only one adhoc scorer can be applied to candidates' scores. This is done to manage the extent of adhoc score modifications and prevent over-modification of scores. \n\nThis code is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter and is used to manage adhoc score modifications in the recommendation system. Below is an example of how this enumeration object can be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.rankers.common.AdhocScoreModificationType._\n\n// Apply a boosting scorer to candidates' scores\nval adhocScorerType = BoostingScorer\napplyAdhocScorer(adhocScorerType, candidates)\n\n// Apply a weighted random sampling scorer to candidates' scores\nval adhocScorerType = WeightedRandomSamplingScorer\napplyAdhocScorer(adhocScorerType, candidates)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines an enumeration object called AdhocScoreModificationType that sets a limit on the number of adhoc scorers that can be applied to candidates' scores.\n\n2. What is an adhoc scorer?\n- An adhoc scorer is a type of scorer that modifies the score of a subset of candidates through various policies.\n\n3. Why is there an \"InvalidAdhocScorer\" type?\n- The \"InvalidAdhocScorer\" type is added solely for testing purposes and should not be used in production."

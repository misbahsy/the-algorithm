  "summary": "The `SwitchingSimsSource` class is a candidate source for recommending Twitter users to follow. It implements the `CandidateSource` interface and takes in a request of type `HasParams with HasSimilarToContext` and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[CandidateUser]`. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to switch between different similarity stores based on the request parameters. The available similarity stores are `cachedDBV2SimsStore`, `cachedDBV2SimsRefreshStore`, `cachedSimsExperimentalStore`, and `cachedSimsStore`. The class selects the appropriate store based on the request parameters and returns the results from that store.\n\nThe `apply` method is the main method of this class. It takes in a request and selects the appropriate similarity store based on the request parameters. It then increments the corresponding counter for the selected store and returns the results from that store.\n\nThe `statsReceiver` parameter is an optional parameter that defaults to `NullStatsReceiver`. It is used to track statistics for the class. The `stats` variable is a `StatsReceiver` that is scoped to the `SwitchingSimsSource` class. It is used to track the number of requests made to each similarity store.\n\nThe `SwitchingSimsSource` object contains a `Identifier` value that is used to identify the candidate source. It is set to `CandidateSourceIdentifier(Algorithm.Sims.toString)`.\n\nThis class is used in the larger project to recommend Twitter users to follow based on their similarity to other users. It provides a way to switch between different similarity stores based on the request parameters. This allows for flexibility in the recommendation system and enables experimentation with different similarity stores. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval switchingSimsSource = new SwitchingSimsSource(cachedDBV2SimsStore, cachedDBV2SimsRefreshStore, cachedSimsExperimentalStore, cachedSimsStore)\nval request = new HasParams with HasSimilarToContext {\n  override def params: Map[String, Any] = Map(SimsSourceParams.EnableDBV2SimsStore -> true)\n  override def similarToContext: CandidateUser = new CandidateUser(...)\n}\nval result: Stitch[Seq[CandidateUser]] = switchingSimsSource(request)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm. It selects a similarity store based on certain parameters and returns a list of candidate users.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including `CachedDBV2SimsStore`, `CachedDBV2SimsRefreshStore`, `CachedSimsExperimentalStore`, `CachedSimsStore`, `StatsReceiver`, `HasParams`, `HasSimilarToContext`, `CandidateUser`, `CandidateSource`, `CandidateSourceIdentifier`, `Algorithm`, `Stitch`, and `NullStatsReceiver`.\n\n3. How does this code handle errors or exceptions?\n- The code does not have any explicit error or exception handling. If an error occurs, it will likely be propagated up the call stack."

  "summary": "This code defines a class called `SocialProofEnforcedOfflineStrongTiePredictionSource` that extends another class called `SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource`. The purpose of this class is to provide a candidate source for a recommendation system that recommends Twitter users to follow. The recommendation system is based on the concept of \"strong ties\" between users, which are defined as close relationships between users who interact frequently. \n\nThe `SocialProofEnforcedOfflineStrongTiePredictionSource` class takes in three parameters: `offlineStrongTiePredictionSource`, `modifySocialProof`, and `statsReceiver`. `offlineStrongTiePredictionSource` is an instance of another class called `OfflineStrongTiePredictionSource`, which is responsible for generating strong tie predictions between users. `modifySocialProof` is an instance of another class called `ModifySocialProof`, which is responsible for modifying the social proof associated with each user. `statsReceiver` is an instance of a class called `StatsReceiver`, which is used to collect statistics about the performance of the recommendation system.\n\nThe `SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource` class that `SocialProofEnforcedOfflineStrongTiePredictionSource` extends is responsible for enforcing a minimum number of social proofs required for a user to be recommended. Social proof refers to the number of interactions a user has had with other users, such as likes, retweets, and replies. The `SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource` class takes in several parameters, including the candidate source (in this case, `offlineStrongTiePredictionSource`), the minimum number of social proofs required (`MinNumSocialProofsRequired`), and an identifier for the candidate source (`Identifier`).\n\nThe `SocialProofEnforcedOfflineStrongTiePredictionSource` class also defines two companion objects: `Identifier` and `MinNumSocialProofsRequired`. `Identifier` is a unique identifier for the candidate source, and `MinNumSocialProofsRequired` is the minimum number of social proofs required for a user to be recommended.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to generate strong tie predictions between Twitter users and recommend users to follow based on those predictions, while also taking into account the social proof associated with each user. It is likely that this class is used in conjunction with other classes and algorithms to provide a comprehensive recommendation system for Twitter users. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval source = new SocialProofEnforcedOfflineStrongTiePredictionSource(\n  offlineStrongTiePredictionSource,\n  modifySocialProof,\n  statsReceiver\n)\nval recommendations = source.getCandidates(user)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a candidate source for Twitter's follow recommendations algorithm that enforces social proof for offline strong tie predictions. It ensures that a minimum number of social proofs are required before recommending a user to follow another user.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several other classes and packages, including `com.twitter.finagle.stats.StatsReceiver`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.candidate_sources.base.SocialProofEnforcedCandidateSource`, `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.transforms.modify_social_proof.ModifySocialProof`, `com.twitter.hermit.model.Algorithm`, and `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.identifier.CandidateSourceIdentifier`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `@Singleton` and `@Inject` annotations?\n- The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that only one instance of this class will be created and shared across the application. The `@Inject` annotation is used to mark the constructor that should be used by the dependency injection framework to create instances of this class and inject its dependencies."

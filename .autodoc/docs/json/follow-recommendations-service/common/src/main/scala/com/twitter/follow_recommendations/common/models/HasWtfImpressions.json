  "summary": "The code defines a trait called `HasWtfImpressions` which provides methods for working with a sequence of `WtfImpression` objects. The purpose of this trait is to add functionality to classes that have a `wtfImpressions` field, which is an optional sequence of `WtfImpression` objects.\n\nThe `numWtfImpressions` method returns the number of `WtfImpression` objects in the `wtfImpressions` sequence. If `wtfImpressions` is empty, it returns 0.\n\nThe `candidateImpressions` method returns a map of `WtfImpression` objects keyed by their `candidateId`. If `wtfImpressions` is empty, it returns an empty map.\n\nThe `latestImpressionTime` method returns the latest `Time` object among all `WtfImpression` objects in the `wtfImpressions` sequence. If `wtfImpressions` is empty, it returns `Time.Top`.\n\nThe `getCandidateImpressionCounts` method takes a `Long` argument representing a `candidateId` and returns the number of impressions for that candidate. If the `candidateId` is not found in the `candidateImpressions` map, it returns `None`.\n\nThe `getCandidateLatestTime` method takes a `Long` argument representing a `candidateId` and returns the latest `Time` object for that candidate. If the `candidateId` is not found in the `candidateImpressions` map, it returns `None`.\n\nThis trait can be used by classes that have a `wtfImpressions` field to easily access information about the impressions for each candidate. For example, if a class `User` has a `wtfImpressions` field, it can mix in this trait and call the `getCandidateImpressionCounts` method to get the number of impressions for a specific candidate. \n\n```scala\nclass User(val wtfImpressions: Option[Seq[WtfImpression]]) extends HasWtfImpressions {\n  // other fields and methods\n}\n\nval user = new User(Some(Seq(WtfImpression(1, 2, Time.now))))\nval counts = user.getCandidateImpressionCounts(1) // returns Some(2)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `HasWtfImpressions` trait?\n- The `HasWtfImpressions` trait defines methods and properties related to WTF (What The Follow) impressions for a candidate.\n2. What is the significance of the `lazy` keyword in front of some of the properties?\n- The `lazy` keyword indicates that the property is only evaluated when it is accessed for the first time, and then its value is cached for future accesses.\n3. What is the data type of the `wtfImpressions` property?\n- The `wtfImpressions` property is an optional sequence of `WtfImpression` objects."

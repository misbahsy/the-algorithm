  "summary": "The code defines an abstract class called SalsaExpansionBasedCandidateSource, which is a candidate source for recommending Twitter users to follow. It takes in a SalsaExpander object as a parameter, which is responsible for expanding the set of candidate users based on the input target. The class extends the CandidateSource class, which is a functional component for generating candidate users. \n\nThe SalsaExpansionBasedCandidateSource class has two methods, firstDegreeNodes and secondDegreeNodes, which return empty sequences of Longs. These methods are meant to be implemented by subclasses that require them. The apply method is overridden to combine the results of both methods and generate a sequence of CandidateUsers. \n\nThe apply method first joins the results of the firstDegreeNodes and secondDegreeNodes methods using the Stitch.join method. It then applies the salsaExpander object to the resulting set of candidate users, along with the maximum number of output results specified by the maxResults method. The resulting set of candidate users is then sorted by score and returned as a sequence of CandidateUsers.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project for generating recommendations of Twitter users to follow. The SalsaExpander object is likely responsible for expanding the set of candidate users based on some algorithm or model, while the SalsaExpansionBasedCandidateSource class is responsible for generating the final set of recommended users. Subclasses of this class can implement the firstDegreeNodes and secondDegreeNodes methods to customize the set of candidate users used by the SalsaExpander object. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval salsaExpander = new MySalsaExpander()\nval candidateSource = new MyCandidateSource(salsaExpander)\n\nval targetUser = new TargetUser()\nval recommendedUsers = candidateSource.apply(targetUser).execute()\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SalsaExpansionBasedCandidateSource` class?\n- The `SalsaExpansionBasedCandidateSource` class is an abstract class that extends `CandidateSource` and provides methods for generating candidate users based on first and second degree nodes using a `SalsaExpander`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `maxResults` method?\n- The `maxResults` method is an abstract method that returns the maximum number of output results for a given target.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method overrides the `apply` method of the `CandidateSource` class and generates candidate users by joining the first and second degree nodes of a target and passing them to the `SalsaExpander` to generate recommendations. The results are then sorted by score and returned as a sequence of `CandidateUser` objects."

  "summary": "The `DisplayLocationProductConverterUtil` object in this file contains two methods that convert between two different models: `Product` and `DisplayLocation`. These models are used in the larger project to represent different types of recommendations that can be displayed to Twitter users. \n\nThe `productToDisplayLocation` method takes a `Product` object as input and returns a corresponding `DisplayLocation` object. The method uses pattern matching to determine which type of `Product` is being passed in and returns the appropriate `DisplayLocation`. If the input `Product` is not recognized, the method throws a custom exception called `UnconvertibleProductMixerProductException`.\n\nThe `displayLocationToProduct` method does the opposite conversion, taking a `DisplayLocation` object as input and returning a corresponding `Product` object. Like the previous method, this method uses pattern matching to determine which type of `DisplayLocation` is being passed in and returns the appropriate `Product`. If the input `DisplayLocation` is not recognized, the method throws the same custom exception as before.\n\nThese conversion methods are likely used in other parts of the project where there is a need to convert between `Product` and `DisplayLocation` objects. For example, if a recommendation is received as a `Product` object but needs to be displayed in a certain location on the Twitter platform, the `productToDisplayLocation` method can be used to convert the `Product` to the appropriate `DisplayLocation`. Similarly, if a user interacts with a recommendation in a certain location and that location needs to be recorded as a `Product` object, the `displayLocationToProduct` method can be used to make the conversion. \n\nHere is an example of how these methods might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.utils.DisplayLocationProductConverterUtil\nimport com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.DisplayLocation\nimport com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models.Product\n\n// Assume a recommendation is received as a Product object\nval receivedProduct: Product = ...\n\n// Convert the Product to a DisplayLocation\nval displayLocation: DisplayLocation = DisplayLocationProductConverterUtil.productToDisplayLocation(receivedProduct)\n\n// Display the recommendation in the appropriate location\ndisplayLocation.display(recommendation)\n\n// Assume the user interacts with the recommendation in the MagicRecs location\nval userInteractionLocation: DisplayLocation = DisplayLocation.MagicRecs\n\n// Record the user interaction as a Product object\nval recordedProduct: Product = DisplayLocationProductConverterUtil.displayLocationToProduct(userInteractionLocation)\n\n// Send the recorded Product to the appropriate service for processing\nprocessRecordedProduct(recordedProduct)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a utility for converting between Product and DisplayLocation objects in the context of Twitter's follow recommendations system.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on two models from the `com.twitter.follow_recommendations.common.models` package and one model from the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.marshalling.request` package.\n\n3. What happens if an unhandled Product or DisplayLocation is passed to the conversion functions?\n- An `UnconvertibleProductMixerProductException` is thrown with a message indicating that the conversion is not possible."

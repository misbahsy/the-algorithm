  "summary": "The code defines a trait called AdhocScorer which extends another trait called Scorer. The purpose of this trait is to provide a way to score candidate users for follow recommendations. It includes a method called score which takes in a target user and a list of candidate users and returns a sequence of scores. \n\nThe trait also includes a deprecated version of the score method which should not be used for instances of AdhocScorer. Instead, the recommended method to use is the one that takes in a target user and a list of candidate users. \n\nAdditionally, the trait includes a value called scoreModificationType which helps manage the extent of adhoc modification on candidates' scores. This value is of type AdhocScoreModificationType which is an enumeration that defines different types of adhoc score modifications. \n\nOverall, this trait provides a framework for implementing different types of scorers for follow recommendations. It can be used in conjunction with other components of the larger project to generate personalized follow recommendations for Twitter users. \n\nExample usage:\n\nAssuming we have a class called MyScorer that extends AdhocScorer and implements the score method, we can create an instance of MyScorer and use it to score a target user and a list of candidate users as follows:\n\n```\nval myScorer = new MyScorer()\nval targetUser = new HasClientContext with HasParams // create a target user object\nval candidateUsers = Seq(new CandidateUser(), new CandidateUser()) // create a list of candidate users\nval scores = myScorer.score(targetUser, candidateUsers) // get scores for the candidate users\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a trait called AdhocScorer which extends Scorer and provides a method to score candidate users.\n\n2. What is the reason for deprecating the score method in AdhocScorer?\n- The score method in AdhocScorer is deprecated because it should not be used for instances of AdhocScorer. Instead, the score method with target and candidates parameters should be used.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the scoreModificationType variable?\n- The scoreModificationType variable helps manage the extent of adhoc modification on candidates' score by limiting the application of only one scorer of each type to a score."

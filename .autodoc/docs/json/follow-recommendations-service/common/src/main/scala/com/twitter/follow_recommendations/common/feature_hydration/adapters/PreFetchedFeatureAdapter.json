  "summary": "The `PreFetchedFeatureAdapter` is an object that provides an implementation of the `IRecordOneToOneAdapter` interface. It is used to extract recent impression and follow features for a user and a candidate. The adapter extracts user, candidate, and pair-wise features. \n\nThe adapter defines several feature variables that are used to extract the features. The impression features include the number of recent impressions for the user and candidate, and the duration of the last impression for the user and candidate. The follow features include the number of recent followers, followed by, and mutual follows for the user. The impression + follow features include the number of recent followed impressions for the user and the duration of the last followed impression for the user.\n\nThe `adaptToDataRecord` method takes a tuple of `(HasPreFetchedFeature, CandidateUser)` as input and returns a `DataRecord`. The method extracts the features from the input tuple and sets the feature values in the `DataRecord`. The `getFeatureContext` method returns a `FeatureContext` object that contains the feature variables defined in the adapter.\n\nThis adapter is used in the larger project to extract features for a user and a candidate that are used in a machine learning model to make recommendations for the user to follow the candidate. The extracted features are used as input to the machine learning model to predict the likelihood of the user following the candidate. The model is trained on a large dataset of user-candidate pairs with labeled follow or non-follow outcomes. \n\nExample usage:\n```scala\nval user: HasPreFetchedFeature = getUser()\nval candidate: CandidateUser = getCandidate()\nval record = (user, candidate)\nval dataRecord = PreFetchedFeatureAdapter.adaptToDataRecord(record)\nval featureContext = PreFetchedFeatureAdapter.getFeatureContext\n// use dataRecord and featureContext as input to machine learning model\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is an adapter that extracts recent impression and follow features for a user and a candidate. It solves the problem of feature extraction for recommendation systems.\n\n2. What are the input and output of the `adaptToDataRecord` method?\n- The input is a tuple of a `HasPreFetchedFeature` object and a `CandidateUser` object. The output is a `DataRecord` object.\n\n3. What are the different types of features that are extracted by this adapter?\n- The different types of features that are extracted by this adapter are impression features, follow features, and impression + follow features."

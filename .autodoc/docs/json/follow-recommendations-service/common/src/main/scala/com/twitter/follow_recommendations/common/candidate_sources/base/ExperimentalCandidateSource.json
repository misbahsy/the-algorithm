  "summary": "The `ExperimentalCandidateSource` class is a wrapper around a `CandidateSource` that makes it easier to experiment with new candidate generation algorithms. A `CandidateSource` is a source of candidates for a recommendation system. The purpose of this class is to allow for experimentation with different algorithms for generating candidates without having to modify the underlying `CandidateSource` implementation.\n\nThe class takes in a `baseSource` which is the underlying `CandidateSource` implementation. It also takes in several parameters that control the behavior of the wrapper. These parameters include `darkreadAlgorithmParam`, `keepCandidatesParam`, and `resultCountThresholdParam`. These parameters control whether or not to darkread candidates (fetch them even if they will not be included), whether or not to keep candidates from the base source, and how many results the source must return to bucket the user and return results (greater-than-or-equal-to), respectively.\n\nThe class extends the `CandidateSource` trait and overrides the `apply` method. The `apply` method takes in a request of type `T` and returns a `Stitch` of `Seq[V]`. If the `darkreadAlgorithmParam` is true, the method fetches candidates from the `baseSource` and processes the results. If the `darkreadAlgorithmParam` is false, the method returns an empty `Stitch`.\n\nThe `fetchFromCandidateSourceAndProcessResults` method fetches candidates from the `baseSource` and processes the results. If the number of results is greater than or equal to the `resultCountThresholdParam`, the `processResults` method is called to process the results. If the number of results is less than the `resultCountThresholdParam`, an empty `Seq` is returned.\n\nThe `processResults` method processes the results based on the `keepCandidatesParam`. If `keepCandidatesParam` is true, the method returns the results. If `keepCandidatesParam` is false, the method returns an empty `Seq`.\n\nOverall, the `ExperimentalCandidateSource` class provides a way to experiment with different candidate generation algorithms without modifying the underlying `CandidateSource` implementation. It allows for easy testing of different algorithms by providing a wrapper that can be easily configured with different parameters.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the larger project?\n- This code is a wrapper for a CandidateSource that makes it easier to experiment with new candidate generation algorithms. It is likely part of a larger project related to Twitter's follow recommendations.\n\n2. What are the input and output types for this code?\n- The input types are a request object of type T, which must extend HasParams, and the output type is a Stitch of a sequence of values of type V.\n\n3. What do the different parameters control and how do they affect the behavior of the code?\n- The darkreadAlgorithmParam controls whether or not to fetch candidates even if they will not be included. The keepCandidatesParam controls whether or not to keep candidates from the base source. The resultCountThresholdParam controls how many results the source must return to bucket the user and return results. These parameters are used to determine whether or not to process the results and whether or not to keep them."

  "summary": "This file contains a set of key-value pairs that define various decider values used in The Algorithm from Twitter project. Decider values are used to control the behavior of the algorithm by enabling or disabling certain features or traffic to different services. Each key represents a specific decider value and has a corresponding default availability value that determines the proportion of requests that will have access to that feature or traffic. \n\nFor example, the `enable_tweet_recommendations_home_product` key controls the proportion of requests where the algorithm returns an actual response for TweetRecommendations Home product. The default availability value is set to 10000, which means that all requests will have access to this feature. On the other hand, the `enable_qig_similar_tweets_traffic` key controls the traffic to QIG to fetch similar tweet candidates, and its default availability value is set to 0, which means that this feature is disabled by default.\n\nThese decider values are used to fine-tune the behavior of the algorithm and optimize its performance. By enabling or disabling certain features or traffic, the algorithm can be customized to meet specific requirements or goals. For example, load shedding can be enabled to reduce the load on the system during peak traffic, or certain traffic can be enabled to fetch similar tweet candidates from different sources.\n\nHere is an example of how these decider values can be used in the code:\n\n```\nif (decider.isEnabled(\"enable_tweet_recommendations_home_product\")) {\n  // return actual response for TweetRecommendations Home product\n} else {\n  // return default response\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `isEnabled` method of the `decider` object is used to check if the `enable_tweet_recommendations_home_product` decider value is enabled. If it is enabled, the algorithm returns an actual response for TweetRecommendations Home product, otherwise, it returns a default response.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n- This file contains a list of DeciderValues with their corresponding comments and default availability values.\n\n2. What is the significance of the default_availability values?\n- The default_availability values indicate the proportion of requests where the corresponding DeciderValue will be enabled.\n\n3. What are some examples of features that can be enabled/disabled using these DeciderValues?\n- Examples include enabling traffic to user tweet/entity/video/ad graphs, enabling loadshedding for certain types of requests, and enabling fetching of real-time aggregates features from Magic Recs memcache."

  "summary": "The `SourceFetcher` trait is a consistent interface for source fetch logic. It provides default functions such as identification, observability, timeout settings, and exception handling. The trait takes a type parameter `ResultType` which is the type of the result that will be returned by the `fetchAndProcess` function. \n\nThe `isEnabled` function is used to determine if a specific source is enabled. It takes a `FetcherQuery` object as input and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe `fetchAndProcess` function fetches the raw sources and processes them. It takes a `FetcherQuery` object as input and returns a `Future` of `Option[ResultType]`. Custom stats tracking can be added depending on the type of `ResultType`. \n\nThe `trackStats` function is a side-effect function to track stats for signal fetching and processing. It takes a `FetcherQuery` object and a function that returns a `Future` of `Option[ResultType]` as input. It returns a `Future` of `Option[ResultType]`. \n\nThe `get` function is called by the top-level class to fetch sources. It executes the pipeline to fetch raw data, process and transform the sources. Exceptions, stats, and timeout control are handled here. It takes a `FetcherQuery` object as input and returns a `Future` of `Option[ResultType]`. \n\nThe `SourceFetcher` object contains a case class `FetcherQuery` which is shared by all `SourceFetcher` instances. It contains the `userId`, `product`, `userState`, and `params` fields. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to fetch and process sources for various products. The `SourceFetcher` trait provides a consistent interface for source fetch logic, making it easy to add new sources and products. The `isEnabled` function can be used to enable or disable specific sources. The `fetchAndProcess` function can be customized to process different types of sources. The `trackStats` function can be used to track custom stats for different types of `ResultType`. The `get` function handles exceptions, stats, and timeout control, making it easy to fetch sources in a consistent and reliable way.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the SourceFetcher trait?\n- The SourceFetcher trait provides a consistent interface for source fetch logic, and provides default functions for identification, observability, timeout settings, and exception handling.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the FetcherQuery case class?\n- The FetcherQuery case class has parameters for userId, product, userState, and params.\n\n3. What exceptions are handled in the get() function of the SourceFetcher trait?\n- The get() function of the SourceFetcher trait handles TimeoutException, GlobalRequestTimeoutException, TApplicationException, ClientDiscardedRequestException, and ServerApplicationError."

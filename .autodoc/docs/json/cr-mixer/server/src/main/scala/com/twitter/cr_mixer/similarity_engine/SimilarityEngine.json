  "summary": "The code defines a trait and an object for a SimilarityEngine, which is a wrapper that takes a Query and returns a list of Candidate objects. The SimilarityEngine provides a consistent interface for candidate generation logic and includes default functions such as identification, observability, timeout settings, exception handling, gating by deciders and feature switch settings, and dark traffic (coming soon). \n\nThe SimilarityEngine trait has two methods: identifier, which uniquely identifies the similarity engine, and getCandidates, which takes a Query and returns a Future of an Option of a sequence of Candidate objects. \n\nThe SimilarityEngine object includes several case classes for configuration, including SimilarityEngineConfig, which includes a timeout and gating configuration, and GatingConfig, which includes a decider configuration and an enable feature switch. The object also includes several methods for caching and applying runtime configurations, such as addMemCache, which adds a MemCache wrapper to a ReadableStore, and getFromFn, which applies runtime configs like stats, timeouts, and exception handling onto a function. \n\nThe SimilarityEngine is designed to be used in a larger project for candidate generation logic. It provides a consistent interface and default functions for generating candidates, and can be extended locally within the project directory. The object includes several configuration options for gating and caching, and the trait includes methods for uniquely identifying the similarity engine and generating candidates. Overall, the SimilarityEngine is a useful tool for generating candidates in a larger project and provides several default functions for consistent and efficient candidate generation.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SimilarityEngine` trait and what methods does it provide?\n- The `SimilarityEngine` trait is a wrapper that generates a list of candidates given a query and provides default functions such as identification, observability, timeout settings, exception handling, gating by deciders and feature switch settings. It provides a `getCandidates` method that returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of candidates.\n2. What is the purpose of the `SimilarityEngineConfig` and `GatingConfig` case classes?\n- The `SimilarityEngineConfig` case class contains the timeout duration and gating configuration for the engine. The `GatingConfig` case class contains the decider configuration and enable feature switch for the engine.\n3. What is the purpose of the `addMemCache` method and what does it return?\n- The `addMemCache` method adds a MemCache wrapper to a `ReadableStore` with a preset key and value injection functions. It returns a `ReadableStore` with a MemCache wrapper."

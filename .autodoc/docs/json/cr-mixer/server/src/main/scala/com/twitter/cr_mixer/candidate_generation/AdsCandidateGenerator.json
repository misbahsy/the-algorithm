  "summary": "The `AdsCandidateGenerator` class is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. This class is responsible for generating ads candidates for a given user and product. It takes in a `AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery` object and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `RankedAdsCandidate` objects. \n\nThe `AdsCandidateGenerator` class has several private methods that are used to fetch source signals, real graph seeds, and initial ads candidates. These methods are called within the `get` method, which orchestrates the entire process of generating ads candidates. \n\nThe `fetchSources` method fetches source signals for a given user and product. It takes in a `AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery` object and returns a `Future` of a set of `SourceInfo` objects. \n\nThe `fetchSeeds` method fetches real graph seeds for a given user and product. It takes in a `AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery` object and returns a `Future` of a map of `UserId` and `Double` values. \n\nThe `fetchCandidates` method fetches initial ads candidates for a given user and product. It takes in a `AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery` object, a set of `SourceInfo` objects, and a map of `UserId` and `Double` values. It returns a `Future` of a sequence of sequences of `InitialAdsCandidate` objects. \n\nThe `interleave` method blends the initial ads candidates to create blended ads candidates. It takes in a sequence of sequences of `InitialAdsCandidate` objects and returns a `Future` of a sequence of `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects. \n\nThe `rank` method ranks the blended ads candidates based on their scores. It takes in a sequence of `BlendedAdsCandidate` objects, a boolean value indicating whether to enable score boost, a score boost factor, and a `StatsReceiver` object. It returns a `Future` of a sequence of `RankedAdsCandidate` objects. \n\nOverall, the `AdsCandidateGenerator` class is a crucial component of the ad generation process in The Algorithm from Twitter project. It fetches source signals, real graph seeds, and initial ads candidates, blends them to create blended ads candidates, and ranks them based on their scores. The `get` method orchestrates this entire process and returns a sequence of ranked ads candidates. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval adsCandidateGenerator = new AdsCandidateGenerator(\n  ussSourceSignalFetcher,\n  realGraphInSourceGraphFetcher,\n  adsCandidateSourceRouter,\n  adsBlender,\n  scribeLogger,\n  globalStats\n)\n\nval query = AdsCandidateGeneratorQuery(userId, product, userState, params, maxNumResults)\nval rankedAdsCandidates = adsCandidateGenerator.get(query)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is for generating ads candidates for Twitter users based on their signals and preferences. It blends and ranks the candidates to provide the most relevant ads to the user.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on several other packages and classes, including AdsBlender, AdsRecommendationsScribeLogger, AdsParams, ConsumersBasedUserAdGraphParams, RealGraphInSourceGraphFetcher, UssSourceSignalFetcher, and StatsReceiver.\n\n3. What is the expected output of the `get` method and how is it generated?\n- The expected output of the `get` method is a sequence of ranked ads candidates, which are generated by fetching source signals and real graph seeds, getting initial candidates from similarity engines, blending the candidates, and ranking them based on their scores and boost factors. The output is limited to a maximum number of results specified in the query."

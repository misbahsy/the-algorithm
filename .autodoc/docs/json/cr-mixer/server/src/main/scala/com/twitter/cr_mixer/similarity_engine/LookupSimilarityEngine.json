  "summary": "The `LookupSimilarityEngine` class provides a map interface for looking up different model implementations. It is used to provide modelId level monitoring for free. The class takes in a `versionedStoreMap` which is a mapping from a modelId to a corresponding implementation. It also takes in an optional `memCacheConfigOpt` which, if specified, will wrap the underlying store with a MemCache layer. This should only be enabled for cacheable queries, such as TweetIds, as consumer-based UserIds are generally not possible to cache.\n\nThe `LookupSimilarityEngine` class extends the `SimilarityEngine` class and overrides its `getCandidates` method. The `getCandidates` method takes in a `LookupEngineQuery` object which contains the actual Query type of the underlying store, a lookup key, and some parameters. The method returns a `Future` of an optional sequence of candidates.\n\nThe `LookupSimilarityEngine` class also has a private `underlyingLookupMap` variable which is used to store the underlying lookup map. If `memCacheConfigOpt` is specified, the `underlyingLookupMap` is created by mapping over the `versionedStoreMap` and adding a MemCache layer to each store. If `memCacheConfigOpt` is not specified, the `underlyingLookupMap` is simply set to the `versionedStoreMap`.\n\nThe `LookupSimilarityEngine` class is used in the larger project to provide a map interface for looking up different model implementations. It is particularly useful for OfflineSimClusters lookup. An example of how to use the `LookupSimilarityEngine` class is shown below:\n\n```\nval versionedStoreMap: Map[String, ReadableStore[Query, Seq[Candidate]]] = ???\nval identifier: SimilarityEngineType = ???\nval globalStats: StatsReceiver = ???\nval engineConfig: SimilarityEngineConfig = ???\nval memCacheConfigOpt: Option[MemCacheConfig[Query]] = ???\n\nval engine = new LookupSimilarityEngine(\n  versionedStoreMap = versionedStoreMap,\n  identifier = identifier,\n  globalStats = globalStats,\n  engineConfig = engineConfig,\n  memCacheConfigOpt = memCacheConfigOpt\n)\n\nval query = LookupEngineQuery(\n  storeQuery = ???\n  lookupKey = ???\n  params = ???\n)\n\nval candidates: Future[Option[Seq[Candidate]]] = engine.getCandidates(query)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides a map interface for looking up different model implementations and provides modelId level monitoring for free. It is used for offline similarity clusters lookup.\n\n2. What are the input and output types of the `getCandidates` method?\n- The `getCandidates` method takes in a `LookupEngineQuery[Query]` object and returns a `Future[Option[Seq[Candidate]]]`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `memCacheConfigOpt` parameter and when should it be enabled?\n- The `memCacheConfigOpt` parameter is used to wrap the underlying store with a MemCache layer. It should only be enabled for cacheable queries, such as TweetIds, and not for consumer-based UserIds which are generally not possible to cache."

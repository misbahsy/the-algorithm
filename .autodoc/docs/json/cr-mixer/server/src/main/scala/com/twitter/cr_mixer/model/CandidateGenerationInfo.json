  "summary": "The code defines several case classes that represent different attributes of a tweet in the context of candidate generation for recommendation systems. \n\nThe `SourceInfo` case class represents the source used in candidate generation and includes the type of source (`SourceType`), an internal ID (`InternalId`), and an optional source event time (`Time`). The `GraphSourceInfo` case class represents the source user graph used in candidate generation and includes the type of source (`SourceType`) and a map of user IDs to scores (`seedWithScores`). The `SimilarityEngineInfo` case class represents the similarity engine used for candidate generation and includes the type of engine (`SimilarityEngineType`), a model ID (`Option[String]`), and a score (`Option[Double]`). \n\nThe `CandidateGenerationInfo` case class combines the `SourceInfo` and `SimilarityEngineInfo` classes and includes an optional `SourceInfo`, a `SimilarityEngineInfo`, and a sequence of contributing similarity engines (`Seq[SimilarityEngineInfo]`). This class is used to represent the composition of a similarity engine, which can be composed of many leaf similarity engines. \n\nOverall, these case classes provide a way to represent the different attributes of a tweet that are relevant for candidate generation in recommendation systems. They can be used to store and manipulate this information in the larger project. For example, the `CandidateGenerationInfo` class can be used to track the different similarity engines used in candidate generation and their contributions to the final candidate list. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval sourceInfo = SourceInfo(SourceType.TweetFavorite, UserId(12345L), Some(Time.now))\nval similarityEngineInfo = SimilarityEngineInfo(SimilarityEngineType.SimClustersANN, Some(\"model123\"), Some(0.8))\nval contributingSimilarityEngines = Seq(SimilarityEngineInfo(SimilarityEngineType.UserTweetGraph, Some(\"model456\"), Some(0.5)))\nval candidateGenerationInfo = CandidateGenerationInfo(Some(sourceInfo), similarityEngineInfo, contributingSimilarityEngines)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SourceInfo` and `GraphSourceInfo` case classes?\n- `SourceInfo` represents the source used in candidate generation, while `GraphSourceInfo` represents the source User Graph used in candidate generation. They both provide information about the source of the candidate generation process.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `SimilarityEngineInfo` case class?\n- `SimilarityEngineInfo` represents the similarity engine (the algorithm) used for candidate generation along with their metadata, such as the type of similarity engine and the score generated by it.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CandidateGenerationInfo` case class?\n- `CandidateGenerationInfo` combines both `SourceInfo` and `SimilarityEngineInfo` to provide information about the candidate generation process. It also includes a list of contributing similarity engines for composite similarity engines."

  "summary": "The `VisibilityRulePreprocessor` class is a part of the Twitter Visibility Engine project and is responsible for preprocessing visibility rules before they are evaluated. The class contains three methods: `filterEvaluableRules`, `preFilterRules`, and `evaluate`. \n\nThe `filterEvaluableRules` method takes in an `evaluationContext`, a `resultBuilder`, and a list of `rules`. It filters out rules that are not enabled in the given context and rules that have missing feature dependencies. If a rule has missing feature dependencies, the method records the missing features and adds a `MissingFeature` result to the `resultBuilder`. The method returns a tuple containing the updated `resultBuilder` and the filtered list of `rules`.\n\nThe `preFilterRules` method takes in an `evaluationContext`, a `resolvedFeatureMap`, a `resultBuilder`, and a list of `rules`. It applies the pre-filtering step to the rules and returns a tuple containing the updated `resultBuilder` and the filtered list of `rules`. The pre-filtering step determines whether a rule can be skipped based on the resolved feature values and the evaluation context. If a rule cannot be skipped, it is added to the filtered list of rules.\n\nThe `evaluate` method takes in an `evaluationContext`, a `safetyLevel`, and a `resultBuilder`. It first retrieves the visibility policy for the given safety level. If the safety level is enabled in the evaluation context, the method evaluates the filtered list of rules using the visibility policy. If the safety level is disabled, the method skips the evaluation and returns a `Skipped` result for each rule in the visibility policy. The method returns a tuple containing the updated `resultBuilder` and the list of evaluated rules.\n\nOverall, the `VisibilityRulePreprocessor` class is responsible for filtering and preprocessing visibility rules before they are evaluated. It is used in the larger Twitter Visibility Engine project to ensure that only relevant rules are evaluated and to optimize the evaluation process. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval preprocessor = VisibilityRulePreprocessor(metricsRecorder)\nval evaluationContext = ProvidedEvaluationContext(...)\nval safetyLevel = SafetyLevel(...)\nval resultBuilder = VisibilityResultBuilder(...)\nval (updatedResultBuilder, evaluatedRules) = preprocessor.evaluate(evaluationContext, safetyLevel, resultBuilder)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a preprocessor for evaluating visibility rules for content on Twitter. It filters and evaluates rules based on their dependencies and features to determine whether content should be visible to users.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on several classes and packages from the com.twitter package, including NullABDecider, Return, Throw, Try, and several others. It also depends on classes from the com.twitter.visibility package, including VisibilityResultBuilder, Feature, Rule, and others.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- The expected input of this code is a set of rules and features for evaluating the visibility of content on Twitter, as well as an evaluation context and safety level. The expected output is a set of evaluated rules and a verdict on whether the content should be visible, as well as any missing features or failed evaluations."

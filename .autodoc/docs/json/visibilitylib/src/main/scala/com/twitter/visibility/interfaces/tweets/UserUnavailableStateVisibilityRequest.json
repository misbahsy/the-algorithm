  "summary": "This code defines a case class called `UserUnavailableStateVisibilityRequest` which is used to represent a request for visibility of a tweet when a user is unavailable. The class takes in several parameters including `safetyLevel`, `tweetId`, `viewerContext`, `userUnavailableState`, `isRetweet`, and `isInnerQuotedTweet`. \n\nThe `safetyLevel` parameter is an instance of the `SafetyLevel` class which represents the level of safety required for the tweet to be visible. The `tweetId` parameter is a unique identifier for the tweet. The `viewerContext` parameter is an instance of the `ViewerContext` class which represents the context of the viewer requesting visibility. The `userUnavailableState` parameter is an instance of the `UserUnavailableStateEnum` class which represents the state of the user who posted the tweet. The `isRetweet` and `isInnerQuotedTweet` parameters are boolean values that indicate whether the tweet is a retweet or an inner quoted tweet.\n\nThis case class is likely used in the larger project to handle requests for visibility of tweets when a user is unavailable. The `UserUnavailableStateVisibilityRequest` object is likely passed to a function or method that handles the logic of determining whether the tweet should be visible based on the parameters passed in. \n\nHere is an example of how this case class might be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval request = UserUnavailableStateVisibilityRequest(\n  safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.High,\n  tweetId = 123456789,\n  viewerContext = ViewerContext(userId = 987654321),\n  userUnavailableState = UserUnavailableStateEnum.Suspended,\n  isRetweet = false,\n  isInnerQuotedTweet = true\n)\n\nval isVisible = handleVisibilityRequest(request)\n```\n\nIn this example, a `UserUnavailableStateVisibilityRequest` object is created with the necessary parameters. This object is then passed to a function called `handleVisibilityRequest` which determines whether the tweet should be visible based on the parameters passed in. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the tweet is visible or not.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the larger project?\n- This code defines a case class for a UserUnavailableStateVisibilityRequest in the context of Twitter's visibility interfaces for tweets. It is likely used to handle requests related to user unavailable states for tweets.\n\n2. What are the possible values for the SafetyLevel and UserUnavailableStateEnum enums?\n- The possible values for the SafetyLevel enum are likely defined in the SafetyLevel model, which is not shown in this code snippet. The possible values for the UserUnavailableStateEnum enum are likely defined in the UserUnavailableStateEnum model, which is imported at the top of this file.\n\n3. How are the isRetweet and isInnerQuotedTweet boolean values used in this case class?\n- It is unclear from this code snippet how the isRetweet and isInnerQuotedTweet boolean values are used in this case class. Further context or documentation may be needed to understand their purpose."

  "summary": "The code above is a Scala object called ShimUtils that contains a single method called preFilterFeatureMap. This method takes in five parameters: a FeatureMap, a SafetyLevel, a ContentId, a ProvidedEvaluationContext, and an optional PolicyProvider. The purpose of this method is to filter a FeatureMap based on a set of rules and return a new FeatureMap that only contains the features that pass the filtering.\n\nThe method first retrieves a set of rules based on the SafetyLevel and ContentId parameters. If a PolicyProvider is provided, it will use the policy for the given SafetyLevel and ContentId. Otherwise, it will use the default set of rules for the given SafetyLevel and ContentId. These rules are stored in a RuleMap object.\n\nNext, the method filters out any rules that are disabled based on the evaluation context. It then filters out any rules that have feature dependencies that are missing from the FeatureMap. Finally, it applies a pre-filter to each remaining rule and removes any features that are not used by the remaining rules.\n\nThe resulting FeatureMap is then returned by the method.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that involves filtering and processing data based on a set of rules. The preFilterFeatureMap method is a utility method that can be used to filter a FeatureMap based on a set of rules. This can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as content moderation or data processing. \n\nHere is an example of how this method might be used:\n\n```\nval featureMap = FeatureMap(Map(\n  Feature1 -> FeatureValue1,\n  Feature2 -> FeatureValue2,\n  Feature3 -> FeatureValue3\n))\n\nval contentId = ContentId(\"123\")\nval safetyLevel = SafetyLevel.High\nval evaluationContext = ProvidedEvaluationContext()\n\nval filteredFeatureMap = ShimUtils.preFilterFeatureMap(\n  featureMap,\n  safetyLevel,\n  contentId,\n  evaluationContext\n)\n\n// filteredFeatureMap now contains only the features that passed the filtering rules\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ShimUtils` object?\n- The `ShimUtils` object provides a method called `preFilterFeatureMap` that takes in a `FeatureMap`, `SafetyLevel`, `ContentId`, `ProvidedEvaluationContext`, and an optional `PolicyProvider`, and returns a filtered `FeatureMap`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `PolicyProvider` parameter in the `preFilterFeatureMap` method?\n- The `PolicyProvider` parameter is an optional parameter that is used to retrieve a set of `Rule`s based on the `SafetyLevel` and `ContentId`. If a `PolicyProvider` is not provided, the method retrieves the `Rule`s from a `RuleMap` based on the `SafetyLevel` and `ContentId`.\n\n3. What does the `preFilterFeatureMap` method do with the `FeatureMap` parameter?\n- The `preFilterFeatureMap` method filters the `FeatureMap` by applying a series of rules to it. The method removes any disabled rules, filters out rules that have missing feature dependencies, and applies a pre-filter to the remaining rules. Finally, the method removes any unused features from the `FeatureMap`."

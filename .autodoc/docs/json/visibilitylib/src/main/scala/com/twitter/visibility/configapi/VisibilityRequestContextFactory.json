  "summary": "The `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` class is responsible for creating a `VisibilityRequestContext` object, which contains information about the viewer context, safety level, and units of diversion. This object is used to determine whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors.\n\nThe `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` takes in two parameters: a `LoggingABDecider` object and a `FeatureSwitches` object. These objects are used to determine whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors.\n\nThe `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` has a private method called `getFeatureContext` that takes in a `ViewerContext`, `SafetyLevel`, and a sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. This method creates a `FSRecipient` object that contains information about the viewer context, safety level, and units of diversion. It then uses the `FeatureSwitches` object to match the recipient and returns a `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext` object.\n\nThe `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` has a public method called `apply` that takes in a `ViewerContext`, `SafetyLevel`, and a sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. This method creates an experiment context based on the user ID and feature context. It then returns a `VisibilityRequestContext` object that contains information about the viewer context, safety level, experiment context, and feature context.\n\nOverall, the `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` is an important part of the larger project as it is responsible for determining whether or not a user is allowed to view certain content based on their safety level and other factors. It uses the `LoggingABDecider` and `FeatureSwitches` objects to make these determinations and creates a `VisibilityRequestContext` object that is used throughout the project to control content visibility. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval factory = new VisibilityRequestContextFactory(loggingABDecider, featureSwitches)\nval context = factory.apply(viewerContext, safetyLevel, unitsOfDiversion)\n// use context to determine content visibility\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a Scala class called `VisibilityRequestContextFactory` that creates a `VisibilityRequestContext` object. It likely solves the problem of managing visibility settings for different types of users or viewers on Twitter.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `LoggingABDecider`, `FeatureSwitches`, `UserRecipientExperimentContextFactory`, and `FeatureSwitchResultsFeatureContext`. These dependencies likely provide additional functionality or data needed to create the `VisibilityRequestContext` object.\n\n3. What input parameters are required to use this code?\n- To use this code, a developer would need to provide a `ViewerContext` object, a `SafetyLevel` object, and an optional sequence of `UnitOfDiversion` objects. These input parameters likely provide the necessary information to determine the visibility settings for a given user or viewer."

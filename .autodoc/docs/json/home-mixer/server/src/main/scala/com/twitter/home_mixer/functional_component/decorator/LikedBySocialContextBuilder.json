  "summary": "The `LikedBySocialContextBuilder` class is a part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is used to build social context for a tweet candidate based on the users who have liked the tweet. It is a decorator for the `BaseSocialContextBuilder` class and overrides its `apply` method to provide custom social context building functionality.\n\nThe `apply` method takes in three parameters: `query`, `candidate`, and `candidateFeatures`. The `query` parameter is of type `PipelineQuery` and represents the query being executed. The `candidate` parameter is of type `TweetCandidate` and represents the tweet candidate for which social context is being built. The `candidateFeatures` parameter is of type `FeatureMap` and represents the features associated with the tweet candidate.\n\nThe method first filters the users who have liked the tweet based on whether they pass both the SGS and Perspective filters. It then calls the `engagerSocialContextBuilder` method of the `EngagerSocialContextBuilder` class to build the social context for the filtered users. The `engagerSocialContextBuilder` method takes in three parameters: `socialContextIds`, `query`, and `candidateFeatures`. The `socialContextIds` parameter is of type `List[Long]` and represents the list of user ids for which social context is being built. The `query` and `candidateFeatures` parameters are the same as in the `apply` method.\n\nThe `LikedBySocialContextBuilder` class is used in the larger project to provide social context for tweet candidates based on the users who have liked the tweet. It is injected into other classes that require social context building functionality and is used to build social context for tweet candidates in those classes.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval likedBySocialContextBuilder = LikedBySocialContextBuilder(\n  externalStrings = HomeMixerExternalStrings(),\n  stringCenterProvider = Provider[StringCenter]\n)\n\nval query = PipelineQuery()\nval candidate = TweetCandidate()\nval candidateFeatures = FeatureMap()\n\nval socialContext = likedBySocialContextBuilder(query, candidate, candidateFeatures)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a decorator for generating social context for a tweet candidate based on the users who have liked it, but only if they pass certain filters.\n\n2. What other components or modules does this code depend on?\n    \n    This code depends on several other modules, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model.candidate.TweetCandidate`, and `com.twitter.stringcenter.client.StringCenter`.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?\n    \n    The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, a `TweetCandidate`, and a `FeatureMap`, and returns an optional `SocialContext`. The `SocialContext` is generated based on the users who have liked the tweet candidate, but only if they pass certain filters."

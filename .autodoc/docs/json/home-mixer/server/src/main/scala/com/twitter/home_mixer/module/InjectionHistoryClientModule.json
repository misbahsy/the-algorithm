  "summary": "The `InjectionHistoryClientModule` is a module that provides an instance of the `InjectionHistoryClient` class. This class is used to interact with the Manhattan service, specifically the `suggestion_history` dataset. The purpose of this module is to provide a singleton instance of the `InjectionHistoryClient` class that can be used throughout the application.\n\nThe `InjectionHistoryClient` class is constructed using a `ManhattanClient` instance that is configured to use the `ManhattanV2` Thrift service. The `ManhattanClient` is constructed with an `appId`, `ManhattanV2` client, `RequestScope`, `serviceName`, and `StatsReceiver`. The `ManhattanV2` client is constructed using a `ThriftMux` client that is configured with a retry policy, timeouts, and TLS settings. The `ThriftMux` client is constructed using a `ClientBuilder` that sets various properties such as the name, destination, and timeouts.\n\nThe `InjectionHistoryClient` class provides methods to read and write data to the `suggestion_history` dataset. The `providesInjectionHistoryClient` method in the `InjectionHistoryClientModule` class provides a singleton instance of the `InjectionHistoryClient` class that can be injected into other classes using Guice.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nclass MyService @Inject() (injectionHistoryClient: InjectionHistoryClient) {\n  def readData(): Future[Seq[MyData]] = {\n    injectionHistoryClient.readData().map { data =>\n      // transform data to MyData\n    }\n  }\n\n  def writeData(data: Seq[MyData]): Future[Unit] = {\n    val transformedData = data.map { myData =>\n      // transform MyData to ManhattanData\n    }\n    injectionHistoryClient.writeData(transformedData)\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides a Guice module for creating an InjectionHistoryClient, which is a client for a Manhattan service that provides injection history data.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries, including Google Guice, Twitter Finagle, Twitter Inject, and Apache Thrift.\n\n3. What is the significance of the retry policy used in this code?\n- The retry policy used in this code specifies that the client should retry failed requests up to two times, but only for certain types of exceptions (TimeoutAndWriteExceptionsOnly and ChannelClosedExceptionsOnly)."

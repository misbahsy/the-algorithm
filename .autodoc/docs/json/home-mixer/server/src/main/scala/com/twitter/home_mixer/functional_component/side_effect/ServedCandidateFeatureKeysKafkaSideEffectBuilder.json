  "summary": "The code defines a class called `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffectBuilder` that is responsible for building instances of `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect`. The class takes in a `ServiceIdentifier` object as an injected dependency. The `ServiceIdentifier` object is used to determine the environment in which the code is running. \n\nThe `build` method of the class takes in a set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects and returns an instance of `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect`. The `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect` object is initialized with a topic name and the set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to build instances of `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect` with the correct topic name based on the environment in which the code is running. This is useful in a larger project where there may be multiple environments (e.g. production, staging, development) and different topics are used in each environment.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in a larger project:\n\n```scala\nval serviceIdentifier = new ServiceIdentifier(\"prod\")\nval builder = new ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffectBuilder(serviceIdentifier)\nval identifiers = Set(new CandidatePipelineIdentifier(\"pipeline1\"), new CandidatePipelineIdentifier(\"pipeline2\"))\nval sideEffect = builder.build(identifiers)\n```\n\nIn this example, a `ServiceIdentifier` object is created with the environment set to \"prod\". This object is then passed to the `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffectBuilder` constructor. A set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects is also created. The `build` method of the `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffectBuilder` is called with the set of `CandidatePipelineIdentifier` objects as an argument. This returns an instance of `ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffect` with the correct topic name based on the environment.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n   This code defines a builder for a Kafka side effect that serves candidate feature keys. It takes in a set of candidate pipeline identifiers and returns a Kafka side effect object that can be used to serve those feature keys.\n\n2. What is the significance of the ServiceIdentifier and CandidatePipelineIdentifier classes?\n   The ServiceIdentifier class is used for MTLS authentication and identifies the service that is being authenticated. The CandidatePipelineIdentifier class is used to identify a candidate pipeline, which is a sequence of stages that a candidate goes through during the hiring process.\n\n3. What is the role of the @Singleton annotation and why is it used in this code?\n   The @Singleton annotation is used to indicate that only one instance of the ServedCandidateFeatureKeysKafkaSideEffectBuilder class should be created and used throughout the application. This is useful for ensuring that the same instance is used across different parts of the application and for optimizing memory usage."

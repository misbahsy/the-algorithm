  "summary": "The code defines a class called `RealGraphInNetworkScoresStore` that is used to hydrate real graph in network scores for a viewer. The class extends the `ReadableStore` trait and takes a `ManhattanKVEndpoint` object as a parameter in its constructor. \n\nThe `get` method of the class takes a `viewerId` of type `Long` as input and returns a `Future` that resolves to an optional sequence of `wtf.Candidate` objects. The `get` method uses the `Stitch` library to run a query on the `ManhattanKVEndpoint` object to retrieve the real graph scores for the given `viewerId`. The query is constructed using the `realGraphDatasetKey` and `valueDesc` objects. The `realGraphDatasetKey` object is a `ReadOnlyKeyDescriptor` that is used to specify the dataset name and the primary key for the query. The `valueDesc` object is a `ValueDescriptor` that is used to specify the type of the value that is being retrieved. \n\nThe `ManhattanRealGraphKVDescriptor` object defines several values that are used in the `RealGraphInNetworkScoresStore` class. The `byteArray2Buf` value is an implicit conversion that is used to convert a byte array to a buffer. The `realGraphDatasetName` value is a string that specifies the name of the dataset that is being queried. The `keyInjection` value is an `Injection` object that is used to convert a `Long` value to a byte array. The `keyDesc` value is a `ReadOnlyKeyDescriptor` object that is used to specify the key for the query. The `valueDesc` value is a `ValueDescriptor` object that is used to specify the type of the value that is being retrieved. The `realGraphDatasetKey` value is a `ReadOnlyKeyDescriptor` object that is used to specify the dataset name and the primary key for the query.\n\nOverall, this code is used to retrieve real graph scores for a given viewer using the ManhattanKV storage system. It is likely part of a larger project that involves analyzing social network data. An example usage of this code might look like:\n\n```\nval endpoint = new ManhattanKVEndpoint(...)\nval store = new RealGraphInNetworkScoresStore(endpoint)\nval viewerId = 12345L\nval futureScores = store.get(viewerId)\nfutureScores.foreach(scores => println(scores))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a class called `RealGraphInNetworkScoresStore` that retrieves real graph scores for a viewer from a ManhattanKVEndpoint.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries including `com.twitter.bijection`, `com.twitter.stitch`, `com.twitter.storage.client.manhattan`, `com.twitter.storehaus`, `com.twitter.util`, and `com.twitter.wtf.candidate`.\n\n3. What is the format of the data being retrieved by this code?\n- The data being retrieved by this code is a sequence of `wtf.Candidate` objects, which are defined in the `com.twitter.wtf.candidate.thriftscala` package."

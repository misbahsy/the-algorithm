  "summary": "The `RealTimeAggregateTimeDecay` class is a default implementation of time decay for real-time aggregates. It takes in a precomputed map from aggregate feature IDs to their half-lives and a discrete timestamp feature ID. The purpose of this class is to apply decay to a given data record based on the difference between the current read time and the stored timestamp in the record. \n\nThe `apply` method mutates the input data record by applying decay to its continuous features. It first checks if the record has discrete features and if it contains the timestamp feature ID. If so, it calculates the scaled time difference between the current read time and the stored timestamp using the half-life of each feature. It then iterates through each feature in the precomputed map and applies decay to its corresponding continuous feature in the data record. Finally, it removes the timestamp feature from the discrete features of the data record.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to maintain real-time aggregates of features over time. For example, if the project is analyzing user behavior on a social media platform, this class can be used to decay the counts of user actions (e.g. likes, comments) over time to give more weight to recent actions. The precomputed map can be generated based on the features of interest and their corresponding half-lives. The `apply` method can then be called on each data record to update its continuous features with the decayed values. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nval featureIdToHalfLife = Map(1L -> Duration.fromSeconds(60), 2L -> Duration.fromMinutes(5))\nval timestampFeatureId = 3L\nval decay = RealTimeAggregateTimeDecay(featureIdToHalfLife, timestampFeatureId)\n\nval dataRecord = new DataRecord()\ndataRecord.putToDiscreteFeatures(timestampFeatureId, System.currentTimeMillis())\ndataRecord.putToContinuousFeatures(1L, 10.0)\ndataRecord.putToContinuousFeatures(2L, 20.0)\n\ndecay(dataRecord, System.currentTimeMillis() + Duration.fromMinutes(1).inMilliseconds)\n\nprintln(dataRecord.getContinuousFeatures) // Map(1 -> 5.0, 2 -> 16.0)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides a default TimeDecay implementation for real-time aggregates.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `DataRecord` and a `Long` value for `timeNow`, and mutates the `DataRecord` by applying decay to it.\n- The `apply` method does not have an explicit output.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `featureIdToHalfLife` and `timestampFeatureId` parameters?\n- `featureIdToHalfLife` is a precomputed map from aggregate feature ids to their half lives, which is used to calculate the decayed value of each feature.\n- `timestampFeatureId` is a discrete timestamp feature id, which is used to determine the time elapsed since the last update and apply decay accordingly."

  "summary": "The `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class is a Scala implementation of a feature hydrator that filters out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. This class is part of the `The Algorithm from Twitter` project and is located in the `com.twitter.home_mixer.functional_component.feature_hydrator` package.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a way to filter out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. This is useful if the likes come from a cache and because UTEG does not fully remove unlike edges. The class uses the `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait to hydrate a set of features for a set of candidates. The `BulkCandidateFeatureHydrator` trait is a trait that defines a method for hydrating a set of features for a set of candidates.\n\nThe `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `timelineService` object to get the perspectives of the users who have liked a tweet. The `timelineService` object is an instance of the `TimelineService` class, which is part of the `com.twitter.stitch.timelineservice` package. The `TimelineService` class is a service that provides access to the timelines of Twitter users.\n\nThe `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `GetPerspectives` object to get the perspectives of the users who have liked a tweet. The `GetPerspectives` object is an object that defines a method for getting the perspectives of a user who has liked a tweet. The `GetPerspectives` object is part of the `com.twitter.stitch.timelineservice.TimelineService` package.\n\nThe `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object to filter out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object is an object that defines a feature for filtering out unlike edges from liked-by tweets. The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` object is part of the `com.twitter.home_mixer.model.HomeFeatures` package.\n\nThe `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class uses the `FeatureMapBuilder` object to build a feature map for each candidate. The `FeatureMapBuilder` object is an object that defines a method for building a feature map for a set of features. The `FeatureMapBuilder` object is part of the `com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap` package.\n\nThe `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class is a singleton class that is injected with the `timelineService` object. The `timelineService` object is injected into the constructor of the `PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator` class.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```scala\nval featureHydrator = new PerspectiveFilteredSocialContextFeatureHydrator(timelineService)\nval query = PipelineQuery(...)\nval candidates = Seq(...)\nval featureMaps = featureHydrator(query, candidates)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a feature hydrator that filters out unlike edges from liked-by tweets.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` and returns a `Stitch` of a sequence of `FeatureMap`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` feature?\n- The `PerspectiveFilteredLikedByUserIdsFeature` feature is the only feature used in this code and it is used to store the filtered liked-by user IDs after the perspective filtering."

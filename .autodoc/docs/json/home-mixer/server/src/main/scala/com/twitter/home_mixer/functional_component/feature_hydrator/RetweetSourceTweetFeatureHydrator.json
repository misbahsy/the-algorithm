  "summary": "The `RetweetSourceTweetFeatureHydrator` is a feature hydrator that bulk hydrates source tweets' features to retweet candidates. It is a part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to add features to retweet candidates based on the source tweet's features. The `RetweetSourceTweetFeatureHydrator` takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` and returns a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`. The `FeatureMap` is a map of features to their values. \n\nThe `RetweetSourceTweetFeatureHydrator` uses the `SourceTweetEarlybirdFeature` feature to add the source tweet's features to the retweet candidate. If it is unfeasible to hydrate the source tweet's feature to the current candidate, the `DefaultFeatureMap` is returned. \n\nThe `DefaultFeatureMap` is a map of features to their default values. It is created using the `FeatureMapBuilder` and contains only the `SourceTweetEarlybirdFeature` with a value of `None`. \n\nThe `RetweetSourceTweetFeatureHydrator` checks if the `sourceTweetsByTweetId` is not empty. If it is not empty, it maps over the candidates and adds the source tweet's features to the retweet candidate's features. If the candidate is not a retweet or the `sourceTweetId` is not found, the `DefaultFeatureMap` is returned. If the `sourceTweet` is not empty, the `SourceTweetEarlybirdFeature` is added to the `FeatureMap` with the source tweet's features. \n\nThis code can be used to add features to retweet candidates based on the source tweet's features. For example, if the source tweet has a high engagement rate, the retweet candidate can be given a higher score. This can help improve the quality of the retweet candidates and provide a better user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nval query = PipelineQuery(features = Some(Set(TimelineRankerInNetworkSourceTweetsByTweetIdMapFeature)))\nval candidates = Seq(CandidateWithFeatures(TweetCandidate(), Map(IsRetweetFeature -> true, SourceTweetIdFeature -> Some(123))))\nval featureMaps = RetweetSourceTweetFeatureHydrator(query, candidates).get\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code is a feature hydrator that bulk hydrates source tweets' features to retweet candidates. It solves the problem of unfeasibility to hydrate the source tweet's feature to the current candidate when the early bird does not return source tweets info, candidate is not a retweet, or sourceTweetId is not found.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `apply` method?\n- The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery` and a sequence of `CandidateWithFeatures[TweetCandidate]` as inputs. It outputs a `Stitch[Seq[FeatureMap]]`.\n\n3. What other features are included in the `features` set besides `SourceTweetEarlybirdFeature`?\n- There are no other features included in the `features` set besides `SourceTweetEarlybirdFeature`."

  "summary": "The code defines a class called `EngagerSocialContextBuilder` that is used to build social context for a user. Social context is a feature that provides additional information about a user's social connections, such as their followers or friends. The class takes in several parameters, including the type of context to build, a `StringCenter` instance, and several `ExternalString` instances that are used to generate the social context text.\n\nThe `apply` method of the class takes in a sequence of social context IDs, a `PipelineQuery` instance, and a `FeatureMap` instance. It first extracts the real names of the users associated with the social context IDs from the `FeatureMap`. It then filters out any invalid social context IDs and maps the remaining valid IDs to their associated screen names. Depending on the number of valid social context IDs, the method generates a social context string using one of three `ExternalString` instances. Finally, it creates a `SocialContext` instance using the generated social context string and other information such as the user ID and landing URL.\n\nThe `mkOneUserSocialContext` method is used to create a `SocialContext` instance when there is only one valid social context ID. It generates a landing URL that points to a deep link and sets the social context text to the generated string.\n\nThe `mkManyUserSocialContext` method is used to create a `SocialContext` instance when there are multiple valid social context IDs. It generates a landing URL that points to a URT endpoint and sets the social context text to the generated string.\n\nOverall, this code is used to generate social context for a user based on their social connections. It is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying social context to users in some way, such as in a timeline or feed. An example usage of this code might look like:\n\n```\nval socialContextBuilder = EngagerSocialContextBuilder(\n  contextType = GeneralContextType.SocialProof,\n  stringCenter = myStringCenter,\n  oneUserString = myOneUserString,\n  twoUsersString = myTwoUsersString,\n  moreUsersString = myMoreUsersString,\n  timelineTitle = myTimelineTitle\n)\n\nval socialContextIds = Seq(123, 456, 789)\nval query = PipelineQuery(...)\nval candidateFeatures = FeatureMap(...)\n\nval socialContext = socialContextBuilder(socialContextIds, query, candidateFeatures)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a case class and an object that build social context for Twitter users based on their social context IDs and screen names.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports classes from several external packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.core`, and `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `private[decorator]` modifier before the `case class` definition?\n- The `private[decorator]` modifier limits the visibility of the `SocialContextIdAndScreenName` case class to the `decorator` package, meaning it cannot be accessed from outside that package."

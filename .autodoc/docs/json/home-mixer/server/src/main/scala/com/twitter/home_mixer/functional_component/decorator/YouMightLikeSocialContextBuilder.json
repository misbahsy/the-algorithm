  "summary": "The `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class is a decorator that adds a fixed 'You Might Like' string above all OON (Out of Network) Tweets. This class is part of the larger project called The Algorithm from Twitter. \n\nThe class takes in a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` as input parameters. The `PipelineQuery` is a query that is used to retrieve a set of `TweetCandidate` objects. The `TweetCandidate` is a candidate tweet that is being considered for display. The `FeatureMap` is a map of features that are associated with the `TweetCandidate`. \n\nThe `apply` method is the main method of the class. It takes in the input parameters and returns an optional `SocialContext` object. If the `TweetCandidate` is not in the network and is not a retweet, the method returns a `SocialContext` object that contains the 'You Might Like' string. Otherwise, it returns `None`. \n\nThe `SocialContext` object is a metadata object that is used to provide additional context to the `TweetCandidate`. It contains information such as the context type, text, URL, context image URLs, and landing URL. \n\nHere is an example of how this class can be used in the larger project:\n\n```scala\nval query = PipelineQuery(...)\nval candidate = TweetCandidate(...)\nval features = FeatureMap(...)\nval socialContextBuilder = YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder(...)\nval socialContext = socialContextBuilder(query, candidate, features)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` object. We then create an instance of the `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class and pass in the `HomeMixerExternalStrings` and `StringCenter` objects. Finally, we call the `apply` method of the `YouMightLikeSocialContextBuilder` class and pass in the `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` objects. The method returns an optional `SocialContext` object that can be used to provide additional context to the `TweetCandidate`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code is a Scala class that renders a fixed 'You Might Like' string above all OON (out-of-network) Tweets.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n    \n    This code has dependencies on several other packages, including `com.twitter.home_mixer.model`, `com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.model`, and `com.twitter.stringcenter.client`.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `apply` method?\n    \n    The `apply` method takes in a `PipelineQuery`, `TweetCandidate`, and `FeatureMap` as input and returns an optional `SocialContext` object as output. The `SocialContext` object is either a `GeneralContext` object with a `SparkleGeneralContextType` and a prepared 'You Might Like' string, or `None`."
